	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added -I$(srcdir)/../libguile.
	(Thanks to Greg Badros.)

	* readline.c (handle_error): Put a cosmetic newline on
	rl_outstream on error before closing it.

	* configure.in: Changed AC_MSG_ERROR into AC_MSG_WARN in case
	readline doesn't exist on the system, so that configuration can
	proceed normally without readline.

	* readline.c: #include "libguile/_scm.h" (so that we get the
	configuration information) and fix other includes so that they'll
	work on a system where guile is not yet installed.

	* Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Added.

1999-07-23  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

1999-07-22  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* readline.c (stream_from_fport): New function.
	(scm_readline): Use it to for the input and output ports.  Close
	the streams after readline returns.
	(handle_error): Close them also when an error occured.

	* readline.h, readline.c: Removed exception notice from copyright
	statement.

1999-05-16  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* Started guile-readline package.  Files are copied from old
	guile-core package and slightly modified.
