This message announces the availability of Scheme Library release slib2d1.

New in slib2d1:

 + Linux RPM distribution.

 + Automated generation of HTTP/HTML static and (multi-client)
   dynamically editable tables from relational databases.
   (HTTP server demo at http://www.foxkid.net:8143/tla/).

 + Reference implementation of Metric Interchange Format:
   "Representation of numerical values and SI units in character strings
   for information interchanges"
   http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/MIXF.html
