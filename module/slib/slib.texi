@node Feature, Requesting Features, The Library System, The Library System
@section Feature

@noindent
@cindex feature
SLIB denotes @dfn{features} by symbols.  SLIB maintains a list of
features supported by the Scheme @dfn{session}.  The set of features
@cindex session
provided by a session may change over time.  Some features are
properties of the Scheme implementation being used.  The following
features detail what sort of numbers are available from an
implementation.

@itemize @bullet
@item
'inexact
@item
'rational
@item
'real
@item
'complex
@item
'bignum
@end itemize

@noindent
Other features correspond to the presence of sets of Scheme procedures
or syntax (macros).

@defun provided? feature
Returns @code{#t} if @var{feature} is supported by the current Scheme
session.
@end defun

@deffn Procedure provide feature
Informs SLIB that @var{feature} is supported.  Henceforth
@code{(provided? @var{feature})} will return @code{#t}.
@end deffn

@example
(provided? 'foo)    @result{} #f
(provide 'foo)
(provided? 'foo)    @result{} #t
@end example


@node Requesting Features, Library Catalogs, Feature, The Library System
@section Requesting Features

@noindent
@cindex catalog
SLIB creates and maintains a @dfn{catalog} mapping features to locations
of files introducing procedures and syntax denoted by those features.

@noindent
At the beginning of each section of this manual, there is a line like
@code{(require '@var{feature})}.
@ftindex feature
The Scheme files comprising SLIB are cataloged so that these feature
names map to the corresponding files.

@noindent
SLIB provides a form, @code{require}, which loads the files providing
the requested feature.

@deffn Procedure require feature
@itemize @bullet
@item
If @code{(provided? @var{feature})} is true,
then @code{require} just returns an unspecified value.
@item
Otherwise, if @var{feature} is found in the catalog, then the
corresponding files will be loaded and an unspecified value returned.

Subsequently @code{(provided? @var{feature})} will return @code{#t}.
@item
Otherwise (@var{feature} not found in the catalog), an error is
signaled.
@end itemize
@end deffn

@noindent
The catalog can also be queried using @code{require:feature->path}.

@defun require:feature->path feature
@itemize @bullet
@item
If @var{feature} is already provided, then returns @code{#t}.
@item
Otherwise, if @var{feature} is in the catalog, the path or list of paths
associated with @var{feature} is returned.
@item
Otherwise, returns @code{#f}.
@end itemize
@end defun


@node Library Catalogs, Catalog Compilation, Requesting Features, The Library System
@section Library Catalogs

@noindent
At the start of a session no catalog is present, but is created with the
first catalog inquiry (such as @code{(require 'random)}).  Several
sources of catalog information are combined to produce the catalog:

@itemize @bullet
@item
standard SLIB packages.
@item
additional packages of interest to this site.
@item
packages specifically for the variety of Scheme which this
session is running.
@item
packages this user wants to always have available.  This catalog is the
file @file{homecat} in the user's @dfn{HOME} directory.
@cindex HOME
@item
packages germane to working in this (current working) directory.  This
catalog is the file @file{usercat} in the directory to which it applies.
One would typically @code{cd} to this directory before starting the
Scheme session.
@end itemize

@noindent
Catalog files consist of one or more @dfn{association list}s.
@cindex Catalog File
In the circumstance where a feature symbol appears in more than one
list, the latter list's association is retrieved.  Here are the
supported formats for elements of catalog lists:

@table @code
@item (@var{feature} . @i{<symbol>})
Redirects to the feature named @i{<symbol>}.
@item (@var{feature} . "@i{<path>}")
Loads file @i{<path>}.
@item (@var{feature} source "@i{<path>"})
@code{slib:load}s the Scheme source file @i{<path>}.
@item (@var{feature} compiled "@i{<path>"} @dots{})
@code{slib:load-compiled}s the files @i{<path>} @dots{}.
@end table

@noindent
The various macro styles first @code{require} the named macro package,
then just load @i{<path>} or load-and-macro-expand @i{<path>} as
appropriate for the implementation.

@table @code
@item (@var{feature} defmacro "@i{<path>"})
@code{defmacro:load}s the Scheme source file @i{<path>}.
@item (@var{feature} macro-by-example "@i{<path>"})
@code{defmacro:load}s the Scheme source file @i{<path>}.
@end table

@table @code
@item (@var{feature} macro "@i{<path>"})
@code{macro:load}s the Scheme source file @i{<path>}.
@item (@var{feature} macros-that-work "@i{<path>"})
@code{macro:load}s the Scheme source file @i{<path>}.
@item (@var{feature} syntax-case "@i{<path>"})
@code{macro:load}s the Scheme source file @i{<path>}.
@item (@var{feature} syntactic-closures "@i{<path>"})
@code{macro:load}s the Scheme source file @i{<path>}.
@end table

@noindent
Here is an example of a @file{usercat} catalog.  A Program in this
directory can invoke the @samp{run} feature with @code{(require 'run)}.

@example
;;; "usercat": SLIB catalog additions for SIMSYNCH.     -*-scheme-*-

(
 (simsynch      . "../synch/simsynch.scm")
 (run           . "../synch/run.scm")
 (schlep        . "schlep.scm")
)
@end example


@node Catalog Compilation, Built-in Support, Library Catalogs, The Library System
@section Catalog Compilation


@noindent
SLIB combines the catalog information which doesn't vary per user into
the file @file{slibcat} in the implementation-vicinity.  Therefore
@file{slibcat} needs change only when new software is installed or
compiled.  Because the actual pathnames of files can differ from
installation to installation, SLIB builds a separate catalog for each
implementation it is used with.

@noindent
The definition of @code{*SLIB-VERSION*} in SLIB file @file{require.scm}
is checked against the catalog association of @code{*SLIB-VERSION*} to
ascertain when versions have changed.  I recommend that the definition
of @code{*SLIB-VERSION*} be changed whenever the library is changed.  If
multiple implementations of Scheme use SLIB, remember that recompiling
one @file{slibcat} will fix only that implementation's catalog.

@noindent
The compilation scripts of Scheme implementations which work with SLIB
can automatically trigger catalog compilation by deleting
@file{slibcat} or by invoking a special form of @code{require}:

@deffn Procedure require @r{'new-catalog}
@cindex new-catalog
This will load @file{mklibcat}, which compiles and writes a new
@file{slibcat}.
@end deffn

@noindent
Another special form of @code{require} erases SLIB's catalog, forcing it
to be reloaded the next time the catalog is queried.

@deffn Procedure require @r{#f}
Removes SLIB's catalog information.  This should be done before saving
an executable image so that, when restored, its catalog will be loaded
afresh.
@end deffn

@noindent
Each file in the table below is descibed in terms of its
file-system independent @dfn{vicinity} (@pxref{Vicinity}).  The entries
of a catalog in the table override those of catalogs above it in the
table.

@table @asis

@item @code{implementation-vicinity} @file{slibcat}
@cindex slibcat
This file contains the associations for the packages comprising SLIB,
the @file{implcat} and the @file{sitecat}s.  The associations in the
other catalogs override those of the standard catalog.

@item @code{library-vicinity} @file{mklibcat.scm}
@cindex mklibcat.scm
creates @file{slibcat}.

@item @code{library-vicinity} @file{sitecat}
@cindex sitecat
This file contains the associations specific to an SLIB installation.

@item @code{implementation-vicinity} @file{implcat}
@cindex implcat
This file contains the associations specific to an implementation of
Scheme.  Different implementations of Scheme should have different
@code{implementation-vicinity}.

@item @code{implementation-vicinity} @file{mkimpcat.scm}
@cindex mkimpcat.scm
if present, creates @file{implcat}.

@item @code{implementation-vicinity} @file{sitecat}
@cindex sitecat
This file contains the associations specific to a Scheme implementation
installation.

@item @code{home-vicinity} @file{homecat}
@cindex homecat
This file contains the associations specific to an SLIB user.

@item @code{user-vicinity} @file{usercat}
@cindex usercat
This file contains associations effecting only those sessions whose
@dfn{working directory} is @code{user-vicinity}.

@subsection Require

@defvar *features*
Is a list of symbols denoting features supported in this implementation.
@var{*features*} can grow as modules are @code{require}d.
@var{*features*} must be defined by all implementations
(@pxref{Porting}).

Here are features which SLIB (@file{require.scm}) adds to
@var{*features*} when appropriate.

@itemize @bullet
@item
'inexact
@item
'rational
@item
'real
@item
'complex
@item
'bignum
@end itemize

For each item, @code{(provided? '@var{feature})} will return @code{#t}
if that feature is available, and @code{#f} if not.
@end defvar

@defvar *modules*
Is a list of pathnames denoting files which have been loaded.
@end defvar

@defvar *catalog*
Is an association list of features (symbols) and pathnames which will
supply those features.  The pathname can be either a string or a pair.
If pathname is a pair then the first element should be a macro feature
symbol, @code{source}, or @code{compiled}.  The cdr of the pathname
should be either a string or a list.
@end defvar

@noindent
In the following functions if the argument @var{feature} is not a symbol
it is assumed to be a pathname.

@defun provided? feature
Returns @code{#t} if @var{feature} is a member of @code{*features*} or
@code{*modules*} or if @var{feature} is supported by a file already
loaded and @code{#f} otherwise.
@end defun

@deffn Procedure require feature
@var{feature} is a symbol.  If @code{(provided? @var{feature})} is true
@code{require} returns.  Otherwise, if @code{(assq @var{feature}
*catalog*)} is not @code{#f}, the associated files will be loaded and
@code{(provided? @var{feature})} will henceforth return @code{#t}.  An
unspecified value is returned.  If @var{feature} is not found in
@code{*catalog*}, then an error is signaled.

@deffnx Procedure require pathname
@var{pathname} is a string.  If @var{pathname} has not already been
given as an argument to @code{require}, @var{pathname} is loaded.  An
unspecified value is returned.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure provide feature
Assures that @var{feature} is contained in @code{*features*} if
@var{feature} is a symbol and @code{*modules*} otherwise.
@end deffn

@defun require:feature->path feature
Returns @code{#t} if @var{feature} is a member of @code{*features*} or
@code{*modules*} or if @var{feature} is supported by a file already
loaded.  Returns a path if one was found in @code{*catalog*} under the
feature name, and @code{#f} otherwise.  The path can either be a string
suitable as an argument to load or a pair as described above for
*catalog*.
@end defun




@node Vicinity, Configuration, Require, Built-in Support
@subsection Vicinity

@noindent
A vicinity is a descriptor for a place in the file system.  Vicinities
hide from the programmer the concepts of host, volume, directory, and
version.  Vicinities express only the concept of a file environment
where a file name can be resolved to a file in a system independent
manner.  Vicinities can even be used on @dfn{flat} file systems (which
have no directory structure) by having the vicinity express constraints
on the file name.  On most systems a vicinity would be a string.  All of
these procedures are file system dependent.

@noindent
These procedures are provided by all implementations.

@defun make-vicinity path
Returns the vicinity of @var{path} for use by @code{in-vicinity}.
@end defun

@defun program-vicinity
Returns the vicinity of the currently loading Scheme code.  For an
interpreter this would be the directory containing source code.  For a
compiled system (with multiple files) this would be the directory where
the object or executable files are.  If no file is currently loading it
the result is undefined.  @strong{Warning:} @code{program-vicinity} can
return incorrect values if your program escapes back into a
@code{load}.
@end defun

@defun library-vicinity
Returns the vicinity of the shared Scheme library.
@end defun

@defun implementation-vicinity
Returns the vicinity of the underlying Scheme implementation.  This
vicinity will likely contain startup code and messages and a compiler.
@end defun

@defun user-vicinity
Returns the vicinity of the current directory of the user.  On most
systems this is @file{""} (the empty string).
@end defun

@defun home-vicinity
Returns the vicinity of the user's @dfn{HOME} directory, the directory
@cindex HOME
which typically contains files which customize a computer environment
for a user.  If scheme is running without a user (eg. a daemon) or if
this concept is meaningless for the platform, then @code{home-vicinity}
returns @code{#f}.
@end defun

@c @defun scheme-file-suffix
@c Returns the default filename suffix for scheme source files.  On most
@c systems this is @samp{.scm}.
@c @end defun

@defun in-vicinity vicinity filename
Returns a filename suitable for use by @code{slib:load},
@code{slib:load-source}, @code{slib:load-compiled},
@code{open-input-file}, @code{open-output-file}, etc.  The returned
filename is @var{filename} in @var{vicinity}.  @code{in-vicinity} should
allow @var{filename} to override @var{vicinity} when @var{filename} is
an absolute pathname and @var{vicinity} is equal to the value of
@code{(user-vicinity)}.  The behavior of @code{in-vicinity} when
@var{filename} is absolute and @var{vicinity} is not equal to the value
of @code{(user-vicinity)} is unspecified.  For most systems
@code{in-vicinity} can be @code{string-append}.
@end defun

@defun sub-vicinity vicinity name
Returns the vicinity of @var{vicinity} restricted to @var{name}.  This
is used for large systems where names of files in subsystems could
conflict.  On systems with directory structure @code{sub-vicinity} will
return a pathname of the subdirectory @var{name} of
@var{vicinity}.
@end defun



@node Configuration, Input/Output, Vicinity, Built-in Support
@subsection Configuration

@noindent
These constants and procedures describe characteristics of the Scheme

implementations.

@defvr Constant char-code-limit
An integer 1 larger that the largest value which can be returned by
@code{char->integer}.
@end defvr

@defvr Constant most-positive-fixnum
In implementations which support integers of practically unlimited size,
@var{most-positive-fixnum} is a large exact integer within the range of
exact integers that may result from computing the length of a list,
vector, or string.

In implementations which do not support integers of practically
unlimited size, @var{most-positive-fixnum} is the largest exact integer
that may result from computing the length of a list, vector, or string.
@end defvr

@defvr Constant slib:tab
The tab character.
@end defvr

@defvr Constant slib:form-feed
The form-feed character.

@code{ms-dos}.
@end defun

@defun slib:report-version
Displays the versions of SLIB and the underlying Scheme implementation
and the name of the operating system.  An unspecified value is returned.

@code{#f}.  If the underlying implementation does not support this
feature then @code{#f} is always returned.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure delete-file filename
Deletes the file specified by @var{filename}.  If @var{filename} can not
be deleted, @code{#f} is returned.  Otherwise, @code{#t} is
returned.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure tmpnam
Returns a pathname for a file which will likely not be used by any other
process.  Successive calls to @code{(tmpnam)} will return different
pathnames.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure current-error-port
Returns the current port to which diagnostic and error output is
directed.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure force-output
@deffnx Procedure force-output port
Forces any pending output on @var{port} to be delivered to the output
device and returns an unspecified value.  The @var{port} argument may be
omitted, in which case it defaults to the value returned by
@code{(current-output-port)}.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure output-port-width
@deffnx Procedure output-port-width port

Returns the width of @var{port}, which defaults to
@code{(current-output-port)} if absent.  If the width cannot be
determined 79 is returned.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure output-port-height
@deffnx Procedure output-port-height port

Returns the height of @var{port}, which defaults to
@code{(current-output-port)} if absent.  If the height cannot be
determined 24 is returned.
@end deffn

@node Legacy, System, Input/Output, Built-in Support
@subsection Legacy

These procedures are provided by all implementations.

@defun identity x
@var{identity} returns its argument.

Example:
@lisp
(identity 3)
   @result{} 3
(identity '(foo bar))
   @result{} (foo bar)
(map identity @var{lst})
   @equiv{} (copy-list @var{lst})
@end lisp
@end defun

@noindent
The following procedures were present in Scheme until R4RS
(@pxref{Notes, , Language changes ,r4rs, Revised(4) Scheme}).
They are provided by all SLIB implementations.

@defvr Constant t
Derfined as @code{#t}.
@end defvr

@defvr Constant nil
Defined as @code{#f}.
@end defvr

@defun last-pair l
Returns the last pair in the list @var{l}.  Example:
@lisp
(last-pair (cons 1 2))
   @result{} (1 . 2)
(last-pair '(1 2))
   @result{} (2)
    @equiv{} (cons 2 '())
@end lisp
@end defun

@node System,  , Legacy, Built-in Support
@subsection System

@noindent
These procedures are provided by all implementations.

@deffn Procedure slib:load-source name
Loads a file of Scheme source code from @var{name} with the default
filename extension used in SLIB.  For instance if the filename extension
used in SLIB is @file{.scm} then @code{(slib:load-source "foo")} will
load from file @file{foo.scm}.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure slib:load-compiled name
On implementations which support separtely loadable compiled modules,
loads a file of compiled code from @var{name} with the implementation's
filename extension for compiled code appended.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure slib:load name
Loads a file of Scheme source or compiled code from @var{name} with the
appropriate suffixes appended.  If both source and compiled code are
present with the appropriate names then the implementation will load
just one.  It is up to the implementation to choose which one will be
loaded.

If an implementation does not support compiled code then
@code{slib:load} will be identical to @code{slib:load-source}.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure slib:eval obj
@code{eval} returns the value of @var{obj} evaluated in the current top
level environment.  @ref{Eval} provides a more general evaluation
facility.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure slib:eval-load filename eval
@var{filename} should be a string.  If filename names an existing file,
the Scheme source code expressions and definitions are read from the

@deffnx Procedure slib:exit
Exits from the Scheme session returning status @var{n} to the system.
If @var{n} is omitted or @code{#t}, a success status is returned to the
system (if possible).  If @var{n} is @code{#f} a failure is returned to
the system (if possible).  If @var{n} is an integer, then @var{n} is
returned to the system (if possible).  If the Scheme session cannot exit
an unspecified value is returned from @code{slib:exit}.

@section Defmacro

Defmacros are supported by all implementations.
@c See also @code{gentemp}, in @ref{Macros}.

@defun gentemp
Returns a new (interned) symbol each time it is called.  The symbol
names are implementation-dependent
@lisp
(gentemp) @result{} scm:G0
(gentemp) @result{} scm:G1
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun defmacro:eval e
Returns the @code{slib:eval} of expanding all defmacros in scheme
expression @var{e}.
@end defun

@defun defmacro:load filename
@var{filename} should be a string.  If filename names an existing file,
the @code{defmacro:load} procedure reads Scheme source code expressions
and definitions from the file and evaluates them sequentially.  These
source code expressions and definitions may contain defmacro
definitions.  The @code{macro:load} procedure does not affect the values
returned by @code{current-input-port} and
@code{current-output-port}.
@end defun

@defun defmacro? sym
Returns @code{#t} if @var{sym} has been defined by @code{defmacro},
@code{#f} otherwise.
@end defun

@defun macroexpand-1 form
@defunx macroexpand form
If @var{form} is a macro call, @code{macroexpand-1} will expand the
macro call once and return it.  A @var{form} is considered to be a macro
call only if it is a cons whose @code{car} is a symbol for which a
@code{defmacro} has been defined.

@code{macroexpand} is similar to @code{macroexpand-1}, but repeatedly
expands @var{form} until it is no longer a macro call.

high-level macros but don't care about the low level implementation.  If
an SLIB R4RS macro implementation is already loaded it will be used.
Otherwise, one of the R4RS macros implemetations is loaded.

The SLIB R4RS macro implementations support the following uniform
interface:

@defun macro:expand sexpression
Takes an R4RS expression, macro-expands it, and returns the result of
the macro expansion.

@defun macro:eval sexpression
Takes an R4RS expression, macro-expands it, evals the result of the
macro expansion, and returns the result of the evaluation.

@end itemize
@subsection Caveat
These macros are not referentially transparent (@pxref{Macros, , ,r4rs,
Revised(4) Scheme}).  Lexically scoped macros (i.e., @code{let-syntax}
and @code{letrec-syntax}) are not supported.  In any case, the problem
of referential transparency gains poignancy only when @code{let-syntax}
and @code{letrec-syntax} are used.  So you will not be courting
large-scale disaster unless you're using system-function names as local
variables with unintuitive bindings that the macro can't use.  However,
if you must have the full @cite{r4rs} macro functionality, look to the
more featureful (but also more expensive) versions of syntax-rules
available in slib @ref{Macros That Work}, @ref{Syntactic Closures}, and
@ref{Syntax-Case Macros}.

@defmac define-syntax keyword transformer-spec
The @var{keyword} is an identifier, and the @var{transformer-spec}
should be an instance of @code{syntax-rules}.

The top-level syntactic environment is extended by binding the
@var{keyword} to the specified transformer.

@example
(define-syntax let*
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let* () body1 body2 ...)
     (let () body1 body2 ...))
    ((let* ((name1 val1) (name2 val2) ...)
       body1 body2 ...)
     (let ((name1 val1))
       (let* (( name2 val2) ...)
         body1 body2 ...)))))
@end example
@end defmac

@defmac syntax-rules literals syntax-rule @dots{}
@var{literals} is a list of identifiers, and each @var{syntax-rule}
should be of the form

@code{(@var{pattern} @var{template})}

where the @var{pattern} and  @var{template} are as in the grammar above.

An instance of @code{syntax-rules} produces a new macro transformer by
specifying a sequence of hygienic rewrite rules.  A use of a macro whose
keyword is associated with a transformer specified by
@code{syntax-rules} is matched against the patterns contained in the
@var{syntax-rule}s, beginning with the leftmost @var{syntax-rule}.
When a match is found, the macro use is trancribed hygienically
according to the template.

Each pattern begins with the keyword for the macro.  This keyword is not
involved in the matching and is not considered a pattern variable or
literal identifier.

@cite{Macros That Work} differs from the other R4RS macro
implementations in that it does not expand derived expression types to
primitive expression types.

@defunx macwork:eval expression
@code{macro:eval} returns the value of @var{expression} in the current

@end defun

@deffn Procedure macro:load filename
@deffnx Procedure macwork:load filename
@var{filename} should be a string.  If filename names an existing file,
the @code{macro:load} procedure reads Scheme source code expressions and
definitions from the file and evaluates them sequentially.  These source
code expressions and definitions may contain macro definitions.  The

@subsection Definitions

@table @asis

@item Scope of an ellipsis
Within a pattern or template, the scope of an ellipsis (@code{...}) is
the pattern or template that appears to its left.

@item Rank of a pattern variable
The rank of a pattern variable is the number of ellipses within whose
scope it appears in the pattern.

@item Rank of a subtemplate
The rank of a subtemplate is the number of ellipses within whose scope
it appears in the template.

@item Template rank of an occurrence of a pattern variable
The template rank of an occurrence of a pattern variable within a
template is the rank of that occurrence, viewed as a subtemplate.

@item Variables bound by a pattern
The variables bound by a pattern are the pattern variables that appear
within it.

@item Referenced variables of a subtemplate
The referenced variables of a subtemplate are the pattern variables that
appear within it.

@item Variables opened by an ellipsis template
The variables opened by an ellipsis template are the referenced pattern
variables whose rank is greater than the rank of the ellipsis template.

@end table

@subsection Restrictions

No pattern variable appears more than once within a pattern.

For every occurrence of a pattern variable within a template, the
template rank of the occurrence must be greater than or equal to the
pattern variable's rank.

Every ellipsis template must open at least one variable.

For every ellipsis template, the variables opened by an ellipsis
template must all be bound to sequences of the same length.

The compiled form of a @var{rule} is

@example
rule  @expansion{}  (pattern template inserted)

pattern  @expansion{}  pattern_var
           |  symbol
           |  ()
           |  (pattern . pattern)
           |  ellipsis_pattern
           |  #(pattern)
           |  pattern_datum

template  @expansion{}  pattern_var
            |  symbol
            |  ()
            |  (template2 . template2)
            |  #(pattern)
            |  pattern_datum

template2  @expansion{}  template
             |  ellipsis_template

pattern_datum  @expansion{}  string
                 |  character
                 |  boolean
                 |  number

pattern_var  @expansion{}  #(V symbol rank)

ellipsis_pattern  @expansion{}  #(E pattern pattern_vars)

ellipsis_template  @expansion{}  #(E template pattern_vars)

inserted  @expansion{}  ()
            |  (symbol . inserted)

pattern_vars  @expansion{}  ()
                |  (pattern_var . pattern_vars)

rank  @expansion{}  exact non-negative integer
@end example

where V and E are unforgeable values.

The pattern variables associated with an ellipsis pattern are the
variables bound by the pattern, and the pattern variables associated
with an ellipsis template are the variables opened by the ellipsis
template.

If the template contains a big chunk that contains no pattern variables
or inserted identifiers, then the big chunk will be copied
unnecessarily.  That shouldn't matter very often.

@subsection Syntactic Closure Macro Facility

@center A Syntactic Closures Macro Facility
@center by Chris Hanson
@center 9 November 1991

This document describes @dfn{syntactic closures}, a low-level macro
facility for the Scheme programming language.  The facility is an
alternative to the low-level macro facility described in the
@cite{Revised^4 Report on Scheme.} This document is an addendum to that
report.

The syntactic closures facility extends the BNF rule for
@var{transformer spec} to allow a new keyword that introduces a
low-level macro transformer:@refill
@example
@var{transformer spec} := (transformer @var{expression})
@end example

Additionally, the following procedures are added:
@lisp
make-syntactic-closure
capture-syntactic-environment
identifier?
identifier=?
@end lisp

The description of the facility is divided into three parts.  The first
part defines basic terminology.  The second part describes how macro
transformers are defined.  The third part describes the use of
@dfn{identifiers}, which extend the syntactic closure mechanism to be
compatible with @code{syntax-rules}.

@subsubsection Terminology

This section defines the concepts and data types used by the syntactic
closures facility.

@itemize @bullet

@item @dfn{Forms} are the syntactic entities out of which programs are
recursively constructed.  A form is any expression, any definition, any
syntactic keyword, or any syntactic closure.  The variable name that
appears in a @code{set!} special form is also a form.  Examples of
forms:@refill
@lisp
17
#t
car
(+ x 4)
(lambda (x) x)
(define pi 3.14159)
if
define
@end lisp

@item An @dfn{alias} is an alternate name for a given symbol.  It can
appear anywhere in a form that the symbol could be used, and when quoted
it is replaced by the symbol; however, it does not satisfy the predicate
@code{symbol?}.  Macro transformers rarely distinguish symbols from
aliases, referring to both as identifiers.

@item A @dfn{syntactic} environment maps identifiers to their
meanings.  More precisely, it determines whether an identifier is a
syntactic keyword or a variable.  If it is a keyword, the meaning is an
interpretation for the form in which that keyword appears.  If it is a
variable, the meaning identifies which binding of that variable is
referenced.  In short, syntactic environments contain all of the
contextual information necessary for interpreting the meaning of a
particular form.

@item A @dfn{syntactic closure} consists of a form, a syntactic
environment, and a list of identifiers.  All identifiers in the form
take their meaning from the syntactic environment, except those in the
given list.  The identifiers in the list are to have their meanings
determined later.  A syntactic closure may be used in any context in
which its form could have been used.  Since a syntactic closure is also
a form, it may not be used in contexts where a form would be illegal.
For example, a form may not appear as a clause in the cond special form.
A syntactic closure appearing in a quoted structure is replaced by its
form.

@end itemize

@subsubsection Transformer Definition

This section describes the @code{transformer} special form and the
procedures @code{make-syntactic-closure} and
@code{capture-syntactic-environment}.

@deffn Syntax transformer expression

Syntax: It is an error if this syntax occurs except as a
@var{transformer spec}.

Semantics: The @var{expression} is evaluated in the standard transformer
environment to yield a macro transformer as described below.  This macro
transformer is bound to a macro keyword by the special form in which the
@code{transformer} expression appears (for example,
@code{let-syntax}).

A @dfn{macro transformer} is a procedure that takes two arguments, a
form and a syntactic environment, and returns a new form.  The first
argument, the @dfn{input form}, is the form in which the macro keyword
occurred.  The second argument, the @dfn{usage environment}, is the
syntactic environment in which the input form occurred.  The result of
the transformer, the @dfn{output form}, is automatically closed in the
@dfn{transformer environment}, which is the syntactic environment in
which the @code{transformer} expression occurred.

For example, here is a definition of a push macro using
@code{syntax-rules}:@refill
@lisp
(define-syntax  push
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((push item list)
     (set! list (cons item list)))))
@end lisp

Here is an equivalent definition using @code{transformer}:
@lisp
(define-syntax push
  (transformer
   (lambda (exp env)
     (let ((item
            (make-syntactic-closure env '() (cadr exp)))
           (list
            (make-syntactic-closure env '() (caddr exp))))
       `(set! ,list (cons ,item ,list))))))
@end lisp

In this example, the identifiers @code{set!} and @code{cons} are closed
in the transformer environment, and thus will not be affected by the
meanings of those identifiers in the usage environment
@code{env}.

Some macros may be non-hygienic by design.  For example, the following
defines a loop macro that implicitly binds @code{exit} to an escape
procedure.  The binding of @code{exit} is intended to capture free
references to @code{exit} in the body of the loop, so @code{exit} must
be left free when the body is closed:@refill
@lisp
(define-syntax loop
  (transformer
   (lambda (exp env)
     (let ((body (cdr exp)))
       `(call-with-current-continuation
         (lambda (exit)
           (let f ()
             ,@@(map (lambda  (exp)
                       (make-syntactic-closure env '(exit)
                                               exp))
                     body)
             (f))))))))
@end lisp

To assign meanings to the identifiers in a form, use
@code{make-syntactic-closure} to close the form in a syntactic
environment.
@end deffn

@defun make-syntactic-closure environment free-names form

@var{environment} must be a syntactic environment, @var{free-names} must
be a list of identifiers, and @var{form} must be a form.
@code{make-syntactic-closure} constructs and returns a syntactic closure
of @var{form} in @var{environment}, which can be used anywhere that
@var{form} could have been used.  All the identifiers used in
@var{form}, except those explicitly excepted by @var{free-names}, obtain
their meanings from @var{environment}.

Here is an example where @var{free-names} is something other than the
empty list.  It is instructive to compare the use of @var{free-names} in
this example with its use in the @code{loop} example above: the examples
are similar except for the source of the identifier being left
free.
@lisp
(define-syntax let1
  (transformer
   (lambda (exp env)
     (let ((id (cadr exp))
           (init (caddr exp))
           (exp (cadddr exp)))
       `((lambda (,id)
           ,(make-syntactic-closure env (list id) exp))
         ,(make-syntactic-closure env '() init))))))
@end lisp

@code{let1} is a simplified version of @code{let} that only binds a
single identifier, and whose body consists of a single expression.  When
the body expression is syntactically closed in its original syntactic
environment, the identifier that is to be bound by @code{let1} must be
left free, so that it can be properly captured by the @code{lambda} in
the output form.

To obtain a syntactic environment other than the usage environment, use
@code{capture-syntactic-environment}.
@end defun

@defun capture-syntactic-environment procedure

@code{capture-syntactic-environment} returns a form that will, when
transformed, call @var{procedure} on the current syntactic environment.
@var{procedure} should compute and return a new form to be transformed,
in that same syntactic environment, in place of the form.

An example will make this clear.  Suppose we wanted to define a simple
@code{loop-until} keyword equivalent to@refill
@lisp
(define-syntax loop-until
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((loop-until id init test return step)
     (letrec ((loop
               (lambda (id)
                 (if test return (loop step)))))
       (loop init)))))
@end lisp

The following attempt at defining @code{loop-until} has a subtle bug:
@lisp
(define-syntax loop-until
  (transformer
   (lambda (exp env)
     (let ((id (cadr exp))
           (init (caddr exp))
           (test (cadddr exp))
           (return (cadddr (cdr exp)))
           (step (cadddr (cddr exp)))
           (close
            (lambda (exp free)
              (make-syntactic-closure env free exp))))
       `(letrec ((loop
                  (lambda (,id)
                    (if ,(close test (list id))
                        ,(close return (list id))
                        (loop ,(close step (list id)))))))
          (loop ,(close init '())))))))
@end lisp

This definition appears to take all of the proper precautions to prevent
unintended captures.  It carefully closes the subexpressions in their
original syntactic environment and it leaves the @code{id} identifier
free in the @code{test}, @code{return}, and @code{step} expressions, so
that it will be captured by the binding introduced by the @code{lambda}
expression.  Unfortunately it uses the identifiers @code{if} and
@code{loop} within that @code{lambda} expression, so if the user of
@code{loop-until} just happens to use, say, @code{if} for the
identifier, it will be inadvertently captured.

The syntactic environment that @code{if} and @code{loop} want to be
exposed to is the one just outside the @code{lambda} expression: before
the user's identifier is added to the syntactic environment, but after
the identifier loop has been added.
@code{capture-syntactic-environment} captures exactly that environment
as follows:@refill
@lisp
(define-syntax loop-until
  (transformer
   (lambda (exp env)
     (let ((id (cadr exp))
           (init (caddr exp))
           (test (cadddr exp))
           (return (cadddr (cdr exp)))
           (step (cadddr (cddr exp)))

                           ,(close step (list id)))))))))
          (loop ,(close init '())))))))
@end lisp

In this case, having captured the desired syntactic environment, it is
convenient to construct syntactic closures of the identifiers @code{if}
and the @code{loop} and use them in the body of the
@code{lambda}.

A common use of @code{capture-syntactic-environment} is to get the
transformer environment of a macro transformer:@refill
@lisp
(transformer
 (lambda (exp env)
   (capture-syntactic-environment
    (lambda (transformer-env)
      ...))))
@end lisp
@end defun

@subsubsection Identifiers

This section describes the procedures that create and manipulate
identifiers.  Previous syntactic closure proposals did not have an
identifier data type -- they just used symbols.  The identifier data
type extends the syntactic closures facility to be compatible with the
high-level @code{syntax-rules} facility.

As discussed earlier, an identifier is either a symbol or an
@dfn{alias}.  An alias is implemented as a syntactic closure whose
@dfn{form} is an identifier:@refill
@lisp
(make-syntactic-closure env '() 'a)
   @result{} an @dfn{alias}
@end lisp

Aliases are implemented as syntactic closures because they behave just
like syntactic closures most of the time.  The difference is that an
alias may be bound to a new value (for example by @code{lambda} or
@code{let-syntax}); other syntactic closures may not be used this way.
If an alias is bound, then within the scope of that binding it is looked
up in the syntactic environment just like any other identifier.

Aliases are used in the implementation of the high-level facility
@code{syntax-rules}.  A macro transformer created by @code{syntax-rules}
uses a template to generate its output form, substituting subforms of
the input form into the template.  In a syntactic closures
implementation, all of the symbols in the template are replaced by
aliases closed in the transformer environment, while the output form
itself is closed in the usage environment.  This guarantees that the
macro transformation is hygienic, without requiring the transformer to
know the syntactic roles of the substituted input subforms.

@defun identifier?  object
Returns @code{#t} if @var{object} is an identifier, otherwise returns
@code{#f}.  Examples:@refill
@lisp
(identifier? 'a)
   @result{} #t
(identifier? (make-syntactic-closure env '() 'a))
   @result{} #t
(identifier? "a")
   @result{} #f
(identifier? #\a)
   @result{} #f
(identifier? 97)
   @result{} #f
(identifier? #f)
   @result{} #f
(identifier? '(a))
   @result{} #f
(identifier? '#(a))
   @result{} #f
@end lisp

The predicate @code{eq?} is used to determine if two identifers are
``the same''.  Thus @code{eq?} can be used to compare identifiers
exactly as it would be used to compare symbols.  Often, though, it is
useful to know whether two identifiers ``mean the same thing''.  For
example, the @code{cond} macro uses the symbol @code{else} to identify
the final clause in the conditional.  A macro transformer for
@code{cond} cannot just look for the symbol @code{else}, because the
@code{cond} form might be the output of another macro transformer that
replaced the symbol @code{else} with an alias.  Instead the transformer
must look for an identifier that ``means the same thing'' in the usage
environment as the symbol @code{else} means in the transformer
environment.
@end defun

@defun identifier=? environment1 identifier1 environment2 identifier2
@var{environment1} and @var{environment2} must be syntactic
environments, and @var{identifier1} and @var{identifier2} must be
identifiers.  @code{identifier=?} returns @code{#t} if the meaning of
@var{identifier1} in @var{environment1} is the same as that of
@var{identifier2} in @var{environment2}, otherwise it returns @code{#f}.
Examples:@refill

@lisp
(let-syntax
    ((foo
      (transformer
       (lambda (form env)
         (capture-syntactic-environment
          (lambda (transformer-env)
            (identifier=? transformer-env 'x env 'x)))))))
  (list (foo)
        (let ((x 3))
          (foo))))
   @result{} (#t #f)
@end lisp

@lisp
(let-syntax ((bar foo))
  (let-syntax
      ((foo
        (transformer
         (lambda (form env)
           (capture-syntactic-environment
            (lambda (transformer-env)
              (identifier=? transformer-env 'foo
                            env (cadr form))))))))
    (list (foo foo)
          (foobar))))
   @result{} (#f #t)
@end lisp
@end defun

@subsubsection Acknowledgements

The syntactic closures facility was invented by Alan Bawden and Jonathan
Rees.  The use of aliases to implement @code{syntax-rules} was invented
by Alan Bawden (who prefers to call them @dfn{synthetic names}).  Much
of this proposal is derived from an earlier proposal by Alan
Bawden.

@section Syntax-Case Macros

@code{(require 'syntax-case)}
@ftindex syntax-case

@defun macro:expand expression
@defunx syncase:expand expression
Returns scheme code with the macros and derived expression types of
@var{expression} expanded to primitive expression types.
@end defun

@defun macro:eval expression
@defunx syncase:eval expression
@code{macro:eval} returns the value of @var{expression} in the current
top level environment.  @var{expression} can contain macro definitions.
Side effects of @var{expression} will affect the top level
environment.
@end defun

@deffn Procedure macro:load filename
@deffnx Procedure syncase:load filename
@var{filename} should be a string.  If filename names an existing file,
the @code{macro:load} procedure reads Scheme source code expressions and
definitions from the file and evaluates them sequentially.  These
source code expressions and definitions may contain macro definitions.
The @code{macro:load} procedure does not affect the values returned by
@code{current-input-port} and @code{current-output-port}.
@end deffn

This is version 2.1 of @code{syntax-case}, the low-level macro facility
proposed and implemented by Robert Hieb and R. Kent Dybvig.

This version is further adapted by Harald Hanche-Olsen
<hanche@@imf.unit.no> to make it compatible with, and easily usable
with, SLIB.  Mainly, these adaptations consisted of:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Removing white space from @file{expand.pp} to save space in the
distribution.  This file is not meant for human readers anyway@dots{}

@item
Removed a couple of Chez scheme dependencies.

@item
Renamed global variables used to minimize the possibility of name
conflicts.

@item
Adding an SLIB-specific initialization file.

@item
Removing a couple extra files, most notably the documentation (but see
below).
@end itemize

If you wish, you can see exactly what changes were done by reading the
shell script in the file @file{syncase.sh}.

The two PostScript files were omitted in order to not burden the SLIB
distribution with them.  If you do intend to use @code{syntax-case},
however, you should get these files and print them out on a PostScript
printer.  They are available with the original @code{syntax-case}
distribution by anonymous FTP in
@file{cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme/syntax-case}.

In order to use syntax-case from an interactive top level, execute:
@lisp
(require 'syntax-case)
@ftindex syntax-case
(require 'repl)
@ftindex repl
(repl:top-level macro:eval)
@end lisp
See the section Repl (@pxref{Repl}) for more information.

To check operation of syntax-case get
@file{cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme/syntax-case}, and type
@lisp
(require 'syntax-case)
@ftindex syntax-case
(syncase:sanity-check)
@end lisp

Beware that @code{syntax-case} takes a long time to load -- about 20s on
a SPARCstation SLC (with SCM) and about 90s on a Macintosh SE/30 (with
Gambit).

@subsection Notes

All R4RS syntactic forms are defined, including @code{delay}.  Along
with @code{delay} are simple definitions for @code{make-promise} (into
which @code{delay} expressions expand) and @code{force}.

@code{syntax-rules} and @code{with-syntax} (described in @cite{TR356})
are defined.

@code{syntax-case} is actually defined as a macro that expands into
calls to the procedure @code{syntax-dispatch} and the core form
@code{syntax-lambda}; do not redefine these names.

Several other top-level bindings not documented in TR356 are created:
@itemize @bullet
@item the ``hooks'' in @file{hooks.ss}
@item the @code{build-} procedures in @file{output.ss}
@item @code{expand-syntax} (the expander)
@end itemize

The syntax of define has been extended to allow @code{(define @var{id})},
which assigns @var{id} to some unspecified value.

We have attempted to maintain R4RS compatibility where possible.  The
incompatibilities should be confined to @file{hooks.ss}.  Please let us
know if there is some incompatibility that is not flagged as such.

Send bug reports, comments, suggestions, and questions to Kent Dybvig
(dyb@@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu).

@subsection Note from maintainer

Included with the @code{syntax-case} files was @file{structure.scm}
which defines a macro @code{define-structure}.  There is no
documentation for this macro and it is not used by any code in SLIB.

The @var{init}s are evaluated in the current environment (in some

the results are assigned to the @var{variable}s, the @var{expression}s
are evaluated sequentially in the current environment, the
@var{variable}s are restored to their original values, and the value of
the last @var{expression} is returned.

The syntax of this special form is similar to that of @code{let}, but
@code{fluid-let} temporarily rebinds existing @var{variable}s.  Unlike
@code{let}, @code{fluid-let} creates no new bindings; instead it
@emph{assigns} the values of each @var{init} to the binding (determined
by the rules of lexical scoping) of its corresponding
@var{variable}.

@subsection Terms

@table @asis
@item @dfn{Object}
Any Scheme data object.

@item @dfn{Instance}
An instance of the OO system; an @dfn{object}.

@item @dfn{Operation}
A @var{method}.
@end table

@table @emph
@item Notes:
The object system supports multiple inheritance.  An instance can
inherit from 0 or more ancestors.  In the case of multiple inherited
operations with the same identity, the operation used is that from the
first ancestor which contains it (in the ancestor @code{let}).  An
operation may be applied to any Scheme data object---not just instances.
As code which creates instances is just code, there are no @dfn{classes}
and no meta-@var{anything}.  Method dispatch is by a procedure call a la
CLOS rather than by @code{send} syntax a la Smalltalk.

@item Disclaimer:
There are a number of optimizations which can be made.  This
implementation is expository (although performance should be quite
reasonable).  See the L&FP paper for some suggestions.

@node Yasos interface, Setters, Yasos terms, Yasos
@subsection Interface

@deffn Syntax define-operation @code{(}opname self arg @dots{}@code{)} @var{default-body}
Defines a default behavior for data objects which don't handle the
operation @var{opname}.  The default behavior (for an empty
@var{default-body}) is to generate an error.
@end deffn

@deffn Syntax define-predicate opname?
Defines a predicate @var{opname?}, usually used for determining the
@dfn{type} of an object, such that @code{(@var{opname?} @var{object})}
returns @code{#t} if @var{object} has an operation @var{opname?} and
@code{#f} otherwise.
@end deffn

@deffn Syntax object @code{((@var{name} @var{self} @var{arg} @dots{}) @var{body})} @dots{}
Returns an object (an instance of the object system) with operations.
Invoking @code{(@var{name} @var{object} @var{arg} @dots{}} executes the
@var{body} of the @var{object} with @var{self} bound to @var{object} and
with argument(s) @var{arg}@dots{}.
@end deffn

@deffn Syntax object-with-ancestors @code{((}ancestor1 init1@code{)} @dots{}@code{)} operation @dots{}
A @code{let}-like form of @code{object} for multiple inheritance.  It
returns an object inheriting the behaviour of @var{ancestor1} etc.  An
operation will be invoked in an ancestor if the object itself does not
provide such a method.  In the case of multiple inherited operations
with the same identity, the operation used is the one found in the first
ancestor in the ancestor list.
@end deffn

@deffn Syntax operate-as component operation self arg @dots{}
Used in an operation definition (of @var{self}) to invoke the
@var{operation} in an ancestor @var{component} but maintain the object's
identity.  Also known as ``send-to-super''.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure print obj port
A default @code{print} operation is provided which is just @code{(format
@var{port} @var{obj})} (@pxref{Format}) for non-instances and prints
@var{obj} preceded by @samp{#<INSTANCE>} for instances.
@end deffn

@defun size obj
The default method returns the number of elements in @var{obj} if it is
a vector, string or list, @code{2} for a pair, @code{1} for a character
and by default id an error otherwise.  Objects such as collections
(@pxref{Collections}) may override the default in an obvious way.
@end defun





@node Setters, Yasos examples, Yasos interface, Yasos
@subsection Setters

@dfn{Setters} implement @dfn{generalized locations} for objects
associated with some sort of mutable state.  A @dfn{getter} operation
retrieves a value from a generalized location and the corresponding
setter operation stores a value into the location.  Only the getter is
named -- the setter is specified by a procedure call as below.  (Dylan
uses special syntax.)  Typically, but not necessarily, getters are
access operations to extract values from Yasos objects (@pxref{Yasos}).
Several setters are predefined, corresponding to getters @code{car},
@code{cdr}, @code{string-ref} and @code{vector-ref} e.g., @code{(setter
car)} is equivalent to @code{set-car!}.

This implementation of setters is similar to that in Dylan(TM)
(@cite{Dylan: An object-oriented dynamic language}, Apple Computer
Eastern Research and Technology).  Common LISP provides similar
facilities through @code{setf}.

@defun setter getter
Returns the setter for the procedure @var{getter}.  E.g., since
@code{string-ref} is the getter corresponding to a setter which is
actually @code{string-set!}:
@example
(define foo "foo")
((setter string-ref) foo 0 #\F) ; set element 0 of foo
foo @result{} "Foo"
@end example
@end defun

@deffn Syntax set place new-value
If @var{place} is a variable name, @code{set} is equivalent to
@code{set!}.  Otherwise, @var{place} must have the form of a procedure
call, where the procedure name refers to a getter and the call indicates
an accessible generalized location, i.e., the call would return a value.
The return value of @code{set} is usually unspecified unless used with a
setter whose definition guarantees to return a useful value.
@example
(set (string-ref foo 2) #\O)  ; generalized location with getter
foo @result{} "FoO"
(set foo "foo")               ; like set!
foo @result{} "foo"
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure add-setter getter setter
Add procedures @var{getter} and @var{setter} to the (inaccessible) list
of valid setter/getter pairs.  @var{setter} implements the store
operation corresponding to the @var{getter} access operation for the
relevant state.  The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure remove-setter-for getter
Removes the setter corresponding to the specified @var{getter} from the
list of valid setters.  The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn Syntax define-access-operation getter-name
Shorthand for a Yasos @code{define-operation} defining an operation
@var{getter-name} that objects may support to return the value of some
mutable state.  The default operation is to signal an error.  The return
value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@noindent
This package offers improvements over previous parsers.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Common computer language constructs are concisely specified.
@item
Grammars can be changed dynamically.  Operators can be assigned
different meanings within a lexical context.
@item
Rulesets don't need compilation.  Grammars can be changed incrementally.
@item
Operator precedence is specified by integers.
@item
All possibilities of bad input are handled @footnote{How do I know this?
I parsed 250kbyte of random input (an e-mail file) with a non-trivial
grammar utilizing all constructs.} and return as much structure as was
parsed when the error occured; The symbol @code{?} is substituted for
missing input.

@subsection Ruleset Definition and Use

@defvar *syn-defs*
A grammar is built by one or more calls to @code{prec:define-grammar}.
The rules are appended to @var{*syn-defs*}.  The value of
@var{*syn-defs*} is the grammar suitable for passing as an argument to
@code{prec:parse}.
@end defvar

@defvr Constant *syn-ignore-whitespace*
Is a nearly empty grammar with whitespace characters set to group 0,
which means they will not be made into tokens.  Most rulesets will want
to start with @code{*syn-ignore-whitespace*}
@end defvr

@noindent
In order to start defining a grammar, either

@example
(set! *syn-defs* '())
@end example
@noindent
or

@example
(set! *syn-defs* *syn-ignore-whitespace*)
@end example

@defun prec:define-grammar rule1 @dots{}
Appends @var{rule1} @dots{} to @var{*syn-defs*}.
@code{prec:define-grammar} is used to define both the character classes
and rules for tokens.
@end defun

@noindent
Once your grammar is defined, save the value of @code{*syn-defs*} in a
variable (for use when calling @code{prec:parse}).

@example
(define my-ruleset *syn-defs*)
@end example

@defun prec:parse ruleset delim
@defunx prec:parse ruleset delim port
The @var{ruleset} argument must be a list of rules as constructed by
@code{prec:define-grammar} and extracted from @var{*syn-defs*}.

The token @var{delim} may be a character, symbol, or string.  A
character @var{delim} argument will match only a character token; i.e. a
character for which no token-group is assigned.  A symbols or string
will match only a token string; i.e. a token resulting from a token
group.

@code{prec:parse} reads a @var{ruleset} grammar expression delimited
by @var{delim} from the given input @var{port}.  @code{prec:parse}
returns the next object parsable from the given input @var{port},
updating @var{port} to point to the first character past the end of the
external representation of the object.

If an end of file is encountered in the input before any characters are
found that can begin an object, then an end of file object is returned.
If a delimiter (such as @var{delim}) is found before any characters are
found that can begin an object, then @code{#f} is returned.

The @var{port} argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
value returned by @code{current-input-port}.  It is an error to parse
from a closed port.
@findex current-input-port
@end defun

@subsection Token definition

@defun tok:char-group group chars chars-proc
The argument @var{chars} may be a single character, a list of
characters, or a string.  Each character in @var{chars} is treated as
though @code{tok:char-group} was called with that character alone.

The argument @var{chars-proc} must be a procedure of one argument, a
list of characters.  After @code{tokenize} has finished
accumulating the characters for a token, it calls @var{chars-proc} with
the list of characters.  The value returned is the token which
@code{tokenize} returns.

The argument @var{group} may be an exact integer or a procedure of one
character argument.  The following discussion concerns the treatment
which the tokenizing routine, @code{tokenize}, will accord to characters
on the basis of their groups.

When @var{group} is a non-zero integer, characters whose group number is
equal to or exactly one less than @var{group} will continue to
accumulate.  Any other character causes the accumulation to stop (until
a new token is to be read).

The @var{group} of zero is special.  These characters are ignored when
parsed pending a token, and stop the accumulation of token characters
when the accumulation has already begun.  Whitespace characters are
usually put in group 0.

If @var{group} is a procedure, then, when triggerd by the occurence of
an initial (no accumulation) @var{chars} character, this procedure will
be repeatedly called with each successive character from the input
stream until the @var{group} procedure returns a non-false value.
@end defun

@noindent
The following convenient constants are provided for use with
@code{tok:char-group}.

@defvr Constant tok:decimal-digits
Is the string @code{"0123456789"}.
@end defvr
@defvr Constant tok:upper-case
Is the string consisting of all upper-case letters
("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ").
@end defvr
@defvr Constant tok:lower-case
Is the string consisting of all lower-case letters
("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz").
@end defvr
@defvr Constant tok:whitespaces
Is the string consisting of all characters between 0 and 255 for which
@code{char-whitespace?} returns true.

@subsection Nud and Led Definition

This section describes advanced features.  You can skip this section on
first reading.

@noindent
The @dfn{Null Denotation} (or @dfn{nud})
@cindex Null Denotation, nud
of a token is the procedure and arguments applying for that token when
@dfn{Left}, an unclaimed parsed expression is not extant.

@noindent
The @dfn{Left Denotation} (or @dfn{led})
@cindex Left Denotation, led
of a token is the procedure, arguments, and lbp applying for that token
when there is a @dfn{Left}, an unclaimed parsed expression.

@noindent
In his paper,

@end quotation

the @dfn{left binding power} (or @dfn{lbp}) was an independent property
of tokens.  I think this was done in order to allow tokens with NUDs but
not LEDs to also be used as delimiters, which was a problem for
statically defined syntaxes.  It turns out that @emph{dynamically
binding} NUDs and LEDs allows them independence.

@noindent
For the rule-defining procedures that follow, the variable @var{tk} may
be a character, string, or symbol, or a list composed of characters,
strings, and symbols.  Each element of @var{tk} is treated as though the
procedure were called for each element.

@noindent
Character @var{tk} arguments will match only character tokens;
i.e. characters for which no token-group is assigned.  Symbols and
strings will both match token strings; i.e. tokens resulting from token
groups.

@defun prec:make-nud tk sop arg1 @dots{}
Returns a rule specifying that @var{sop} be called when @var{tk} is
parsed.  If @var{sop} is a procedure, it is called with @var{tk} and
@var{arg1} @dots{} as its arguments; the resulting value is incorporated
into the expression being built.  Otherwise, @code{(list @var{sop}
@var{arg1} @dots{})} is incorporated.
@end defun

@noindent
If no NUD has been defined for a token; then if that token is a string,
it is converted to a symbol and returned; if not a string, the token is
returned.

@defun prec:make-led tk sop arg1 @dots{}
Returns a rule specifying that @var{sop} be called when @var{tk} is
parsed and @var{left} has an unclaimed parsed expression.  If @var{sop}
is a procedure, it is called with @var{left}, @var{tk}, and @var{arg1}
@dots{} as its arguments; the resulting value is incorporated into the
expression being built.  Otherwise, @var{left} is incorporated.
@end defun

@noindent
If no LED has been defined for a token, and @var{left} is set, the
parser issues a warning.

@node Grammar Rule Definition,  , Nud and Led Definition, Precedence Parsing
@subsection Grammar Rule Definition

@noindent
Here are procedures for defining rules for the syntax types introduced
in @ref{Precedence Parsing Overview}.

@noindent
For the rule-defining procedures that follow, the variable @var{tk} may
be a character, string, or symbol, or a list composed of characters,
strings, and symbols.  Each element of @var{tk} is treated as though the
procedure were called for each element.

@noindent
For procedures prec:delim, @dots{}, prec:prestfix, if the @var{sop}
argument is @code{#f}, then the token which triggered this rule is
converted to a symbol and returned.  A false @var{sop} argument to the
procedures prec:commentfix, prec:matchfix, or prec:inmatchfix has a
different meaning.

@noindent
Character @var{tk} arguments will match only character tokens;
i.e. characters for which no token-group is assigned.  Symbols and
strings will both match token strings; i.e. tokens resulting from token
groups.

@defun prec:delim tk
Returns a rule specifying that @var{tk} should not be returned from
parsing; i.e. @var{tk}'s function is purely syntactic.  The end-of-file
is always treated as a delimiter.
@end defun

@defun prec:nofix tk sop
Returns a rule specifying the following actions take place when @var{tk}
is parsed:

rules currently in effect.
@item
@code{prec:parse1} is called with binding-power @var{bp}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The rules @var{rule1} @dots{} augment and, in case of conflict, override

@item
One expression is parsed with binding-power @var{lbp}.  If instead a

Expressions are parsed with binding-power @var{bp} as far as they are
interleaved with the token @var{tk}.
@item
If @var{sop} is a procedure, it is applied to the list of @var{left} and
the parsed expressions; the resulting value is incorporated into the

@itemize @bullet
@item
If @var{sop} is a procedure, it is called with the @var{left} expression;
the resulting value is incorporated into the expression being built.
Otherwise, the list of @var{sop} and the @var{left} expression is
incorporated.
@end itemize

Returns rules specifying the following actions take place when @var{tk}
is parsed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
The rules @var{rule1} @dots{} augment and, in case of conflict, override
rules currently in effect.
@item
Characters are read until and end-of-file or a sequence of characters
is read which matches the @emph{string} @var{match}.
@item
If @var{stp} is a procedure, it is called with the string of all that
was read between the @var{tk} and @var{match} (exclusive).
@item
The ruleset in effect before @var{tk} was parsed is restored;
@var{rule1} @dots{} are forgotten.
@end itemize

Parsing of commentfix syntax differs from the others in several ways.
It reads directly from input without tokenizing; It calls @var{stp} but
does not return its value; nay any value.  I added the @var{stp}
argument so that comment text could be echoed.

@deffnx Procedure fprintf port format arg1 @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure sprintf str format arg1 @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure sprintf #f format arg1 @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure sprintf k format arg1 @dots{}

Each function converts, formats, and outputs its @var{arg1} @dots{}
arguments according to the control string @var{format} argument and
returns the number of characters output.

@code{printf} sends its output to the port @code{(current-output-port)}.
@code{fprintf} sends its output to the port @var{port}.  @code{sprintf}
@code{string-set!}s locations of the non-constant string argument
@var{str} to the output characters.

Two extensions of @code{sprintf} return new strings.  If the first
argument is @code{#f}, then the returned string's length is as many
characters as specified by the @var{format} and data; if the first
argument is a non-negative integer @var{k}, then the length of the
returned string is also bounded by @var{k}.

The string @var{format} contains plain characters which are copied to
the output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which results
in fetching zero or more of the arguments @var{arg1} @dots{}.  The
results are undefined if there are an insufficient number of arguments
for the format.  If @var{format} is exhausted while some of the
@var{arg1} @dots{} arguments remain unused, the excess @var{arg1}
@dots{} arguments are ignored.

The conversion specifications in a format string have the form:

@example
% @r{[} @var{flags} @r{]} @r{[} @var{width} @r{]} @r{[} . @var{precision} @r{]} @r{[} @var{type} @r{]} @var{conversion}
@end example

An output conversion specifications consist of an initial @samp{%}
character followed in sequence by:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Zero or more @dfn{flag characters} that modify the normal behavior of
the conversion specification.

@table @asis
@item @samp{-}
Left-justify the result in the field.  Normally the result is
right-justified.

@item @samp{+}
For the signed @samp{%d} and @samp{%i} conversions and all inexact
conversions, prefix a plus sign if the value is positive.

@item @samp{ }
For the signed @samp{%d} and @samp{%i} conversions, if the result
doesn't start with a plus or minus sign, prefix it with a space
character instead.  Since the @samp{+} flag ensures that the result
includes a sign, this flag is ignored if both are specified.

@item @samp{#}
For inexact conversions, @samp{#} specifies that the result should
always include a decimal point, even if no digits follow it.  For the
@samp{%g} and @samp{%G} conversions, this also forces trailing zeros
after the decimal point to be printed where they would otherwise be
elided.

For the @samp{%o} conversion, force the leading digit to be @samp{0}, as
if by increasing the precision.  For @samp{%x} or @samp{%X}, prefix a
leading @samp{0x} or @samp{0X} (respectively) to the result.  This
doesn't do anything useful for the @samp{%d}, @samp{%i}, or @samp{%u}
conversions.  Using this flag produces output which can be parsed by the
@code{scanf} functions with the @samp{%i} conversion (@pxref{Standard
Formatted Input}).


@item @samp{0}
Pad the field with zeros instead of spaces.  The zeros are placed after
any indication of sign or base.  This flag is ignored if the @samp{-}
flag is also specified, or if a precision is specified for an exact
converson.
@end table

@item
An optional decimal integer specifying the @dfn{minimum field width}.
If the normal conversion produces fewer characters than this, the field
is padded (with spaces or zeros per the @samp{0} flag) to the specified
width.  This is a @emph{minimum} width; if the normal conversion
produces more characters than this, the field is @emph{not} truncated.
@cindex minimum field width (@code{printf})

Alternatively, if the field width is @samp{*}, the next argument in the
argument list (before the actual value to be printed) is used as the
field width.  The width value must be an integer.  If the value is
negative it is as though the @samp{-} flag is set (see above) and the
absolute value is used as the field width.

@item
An optional @dfn{precision} to specify the number of digits to be
written for numeric conversions and the maximum field width for string
conversions.  The precision is specified by a period (@samp{.}) followed
optionally by a decimal integer (which defaults to zero if omitted).
@cindex precision (@code{printf})

Alternatively, if the precision is @samp{.*}, the next argument in the
argument list (before the actual value to be printed) is used as the
precision.  The value must be an integer, and is ignored if negative.
If you specify @samp{*} for both the field width and precision, the
field width argument precedes the precision argument.  The @samp{.*}
precision is an enhancement.  C library versions may not accept this
syntax.

For the @samp{%f}, @samp{%e}, and @samp{%E} conversions, the precision
specifies how many digits follow the decimal-point character.  The
default precision is @code{6}.  If the precision is explicitly @code{0},
the decimal point character is suppressed.

For the @samp{%g} and @samp{%G} conversions, the precision specifies how
many significant digits to print.  Significant digits are the first
digit before the decimal point, and all the digits after it.  If the
precision is @code{0} or not specified for @samp{%g} or @samp{%G}, it is
treated like a value of @code{1}.  If the value being printed cannot be
expressed accurately in the specified number of digits, the value is
rounded to the nearest number that fits.

For exact conversions, if a precision is supplied it specifies the
minimum number of digits to appear; leading zeros are produced if
necessary.  If a precision is not supplied, the number is printed with
as many digits as necessary.  Converting an exact @samp{0} with an
explicit precision of zero produces no characters.

@item
An optional one of @samp{l}, @samp{h} or @samp{L}, which is ignored for
numeric conversions.  It is an error to specify these modifiers for
non-numeric conversions.

@item
A character that specifies the conversion to be applied.
@end itemize

@subsubsection Exact Conversions

@table @asis
@item @samp{d}, @samp{i}
Print an integer as a signed decimal number.  @samp{%d} and @samp{%i}
are synonymous for output, but are different when used with @code{scanf}
for input (@pxref{Standard Formatted Input}).

@item @samp{o}
Print an integer as an unsigned octal number.

@item @samp{u}
Print an integer as an unsigned decimal number.

@item @samp{x}, @samp{X}
Print an integer as an unsigned hexadecimal number.  @samp{%x} prints
using the digits @samp{0123456789abcdef}.  @samp{%X} prints using the
digits @samp{0123456789ABCDEF}.
@end table

@subsubsection Inexact Conversions

@table @asis
@item @samp{f}
Print a floating-point number in fixed-point notation.

@item @samp{e}, @samp{E}
Print a floating-point number in exponential notation.  @samp{%e} prints
@samp{e} between mantissa and exponont.  @samp{%E} prints @samp{E}
between mantissa and exponont.

@item @samp{g}, @samp{G}
Print a floating-point number in either fixed or exponential notation,
whichever is more appropriate for its magnitude.  Unless an @samp{#}
flag has been supplied, trailing zeros after a decimal point will be
stripped off.  @samp{%g} prints @samp{e} between mantissa and exponont.
@samp{%G} prints @samp{E} between mantissa and exponent.

@item @samp{k}, @samp{K}
Print a number like @samp{%g}, except that an SI prefix is output after
the number, which is scaled accordingly.  @samp{%K} outputs a space
between number and prefix, @samp{%k} does not.

@end table

@subsubsection Other Conversions
@table @asis
@item @samp{c}
Print a single character.  The @samp{-} flag is the only one which can
be specified.  It is an error to specify a precision.

@item @samp{s}
Print a string.  The @samp{-} flag is the only one which can be
specified.  A precision specifies the maximum number of characters to
output; otherwise all characters in the string are output.

@item @samp{a}, @samp{A}
Print a scheme expression.  The @samp{-} flag left-justifies the output.
The @samp{#} flag specifies that strings and characters should be quoted
as by @code{write} (which can be read using @code{read}); otherwise,
output is as @code{display} prints.  A precision specifies the maximum
number of characters to output; otherwise as many characters as needed
are output.

@emph{Note:} @samp{%a} and @samp{%A} are SLIB extensions.

@c @item @samp{p}
@c Print the value of a pointer.

@c @item @samp{n}
@c Get the number of characters printed so far.  See @ref{Other Output Conversions}.
@c Note that this conversion specification never produces any output.

@c @item @samp{m}
@c Print the string corresponding to the value of @code{errno}.
@c (This is a GNU extension.)
@c @xref{Other Output Conversions}.

@item @samp{%}

@samp{%%}.

@code{scanf-read-list} returns a list of the items specified as far as

The argument to a @code{substring} expression in @var{arg1} @dots{} must

The control string, @var{format}, contains conversion specifications and
other characters used to direct interpretation of input sequences.  The
control string contains:

@itemize @bullet
@item White-space characters (blanks, tabs, newlines, or formfeeds)
that cause input to be read (and discarded) up to the next
non-white-space character.

@item An ordinary character (not @samp{%}) that must match the next
character of the input stream.

@item Conversion specifications, consisting of the character @samp{%}, an
optional assignment suppressing character @samp{*}, an optional
numerical maximum-field width, an optional @samp{l}, @samp{h} or
@samp{L} which is ignored, and a conversion code.

@c @item The conversion specification can alternatively be prefixed by
@c the character sequence @samp{%n$} instead of the character @samp{%},
@c where @var{n} is a decimal integer in the range.  The @samp{%n$}
@c construction indicates that the value of the next input field should be
@c placed in the @var{n}th place in the return list, rather than to the next
@c unused one.  The two forms of introducing a conversion specification,
@c @samp{%} and @samp{%n$}, must not be mixed within a single format string
@c with the following exception: Skip fields (see below) can be designated
@c as @samp{%*} or @samp{%n$*}.  In the latter case, @var{n} is ignored.

@end itemize

Unless the specification contains the @samp{n} conversion character
(described below), a conversion specification directs the conversion of
the next input field.  The result of a conversion specification is
returned in the position of the corresponding argument points, unless
@samp{*} indicates assignment suppression.  Assignment suppression
provides a way to describe an input field to be skipped.  An input field
is defined as a string of characters; it extends to the next
inappropriate character or until the field width, if specified, is
exhausted.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} This specification of format strings differs from the
@cite{ANSI C} and @cite{POSIX} specifications.  In SLIB, white space
before an input field is not skipped unless white space appears before
the conversion specification in the format string.  In order to write
format strings which work identically with @cite{ANSI C} and SLIB,
prepend whitespace to all conversion specifications except @samp{[} and
@samp{c}.
@end quotation

The conversion code indicates the interpretation of the input field; For
a suppressed field, no value is returned.  The following conversion
codes are legal:

@table @asis

@item @samp{%}
A single % is expected in the input at this point; no value is returned.

@item @samp{d}, @samp{D}
A decimal integer is expected.

@item @samp{u}, @samp{U}
An unsigned decimal integer is expected.

@item @samp{o}, @samp{O}
An octal integer is expected.

@item @samp{x}, @samp{X}
A hexadecimal integer is expected.

@item @samp{i}
An integer is expected.  Returns the value of the next input item,
interpreted according to C conventions; a leading @samp{0} implies
octal, a leading @samp{0x} implies hexadecimal; otherwise, decimal is
assumed.

@item @samp{n}
Returns the total number of bytes (including white space) read by
@code{scanf}.  No input is consumed by @code{%n}.

@item @samp{f}, @samp{F}, @samp{e}, @samp{E}, @samp{g}, @samp{G}
A floating-point number is expected.  The input format for
floating-point numbers is an optionally signed string of digits,
possibly containing a radix character @samp{.}, followed by an optional
exponent field consisting of an @samp{E} or an @samp{e}, followed by an
optional @samp{+}, @samp{-}, or space, followed by an integer.

@item @samp{c}, @samp{C}
@var{Width} characters are expected.  The normal skip-over-white-space
is suppressed in this case; to read the next non-space character, use
@samp{%1s}.  If a field width is given, a string is returned; up to the
indicated number of characters is read.

@item @samp{s}, @samp{S}
A character string is expected The input field is terminated by a
white-space character.  @code{scanf} cannot read a null string.

@item @samp{[}
Indicates string data and the normal skip-over-leading-white-space is
suppressed.  The left bracket is followed by a set of characters, called
the scanset, and a right bracket; the input field is the maximal
sequence of input characters consisting entirely of characters in the
scanset.  @samp{^}, when it appears as the first character in the
scanset, serves as a complement operator and redefines the scanset as
the set of all characters not contained in the remainder of the scanset
string.  Construction of the scanset follows certain conventions.  A
range of characters may be represented by the construct first-last,
enabling @samp{[0123456789]} to be expressed @samp{[0-9]}.  Using this
convention, first must be lexically less than or equal to last;
otherwise, the dash stands for itself.  The dash also stands for itself
when it is the first or the last character in the scanset.  To include
the right square bracket as an element of the scanset, it must appear as
the first character (possibly preceded by a @samp{^}) of the scanset, in
which case it will not be interpreted syntactically as the closing
bracket.  At least one character must match for this conversion to
succeed.
@end table

The @code{scanf} functions terminate their conversions at end-of-file,
at the end of the control string, or when an input character conflicts
with the control string.  In the latter case, the offending character is
left unread in the input stream.

@subsection Getopt

@code{(require 'getopt)}
@ftindex getopt

This routine implements Posix command line argument parsing.  Notice
that returning values through global variables means that @code{getopt}
is @emph{not} reentrant.

@defvar *optind*
Is the index of the current element of the command line.  It is
initially one.  In order to parse a new command line or reparse an old
one, @var{*opting*} must be reset.
@end defvar

@defvar *optarg*
Is set by getopt to the (string) option-argument of the current option.
@end defvar

@deffn Procedure getopt argc argv optstring
Returns the next option letter in @var{argv} (starting from
@code{(vector-ref argv *optind*)}) that matches a letter in
@var{optstring}.  @var{argv} is a vector or list of strings, the 0th of
which getopt usually ignores. @var{argc} is the argument count, usually
the length of @var{argv}.  @var{optstring} is a string of recognized
option characters; if a character is followed by a colon, the option
takes an argument which may be immediately following it in the string or
in the next element of @var{argv}.

@var{*optind*} is the index of the next element of the @var{argv} vector
to be processed.  It is initialized to 1 by @file{getopt.scm}, and
@code{getopt} updates it when it finishes with each element of
@var{argv}.

@code{getopt} returns the next option character from @var{argv} that
matches a character in @var{optstring}, if there is one that matches.
If the option takes an argument, @code{getopt} sets the variable
@var{*optarg*} to the option-argument as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the option was the last character in the string pointed to by an
element of @var{argv}, then @var{*optarg*} contains the next element of
@var{argv}, and @var{*optind*} is incremented by 2.  If the resulting
value of @var{*optind*} is greater than or equal to @var{argc}, this
indicates a missing option argument, and @code{getopt} returns an error
indication.

@item
Otherwise, @var{*optarg*} is set to the string following the option
character in that element of @var{argv}, and @var{*optind*} is
incremented by 1.
@end itemize

If, when @code{getopt} is called, the string @code{(vector-ref argv
*optind*)} either does not begin with the character @code{#\-} or is
just @code{"-"}, @code{getopt} returns @code{#f} without changing
@var{*optind*}.  If @code{(vector-ref argv *optind*)} is the string
@code{"--"}, @code{getopt} returns @code{#f} after incrementing
@var{*optind*}.

If @code{getopt} encounters an option character that is not contained in
@var{optstring}, it returns the question-mark @code{#\?} character.  If
it detects a missing option argument, it returns the colon character
@code{#\:} if the first character of @var{optstring} was a colon, or a
question-mark character otherwise.  In either case, @code{getopt} sets
the variable @var{getopt:opt} to the option character that caused the
error.

The special option @code{"--"} can be used to delimit the end of the
options; @code{#f} is returned, and @code{"--"} is skipped.

RETURN VALUE

@code{getopt} returns the next option character specified on the command
line.  A colon @code{#\:} is returned if @code{getopt} detects a missing
argument and the first character of @var{optstring} was a colon
@code{#\:}.

A question-mark @code{#\?} is returned if @code{getopt} encounters an
option character not in @var{optstring} or detects a missing argument
and the first character of @var{optstring} was not a colon @code{#\:}.

Otherwise, @code{getopt} returns @code{#f} when all command line options
have been parsed.

Example:
@lisp
#! /usr/local/bin/scm
;;;This code is SCM specific.
(define argv (program-arguments))
(require 'getopt)
@ftindex getopt

(define opts ":a:b:cd")

              (print "argv[" *optind* "]="

@subsection Getopt--

@defun getopt-- argc argv optstring
The procedure @code{getopt--} is an extended version of @code{getopt}
which parses @dfn{long option names} of the form
@samp{--hold-the-onions} and @samp{--verbosity-level=extreme}.
@w{@code{Getopt--}} behaves as @code{getopt} except for non-empty
options beginning with @samp{--}.

Options beginning with @samp{--} are returned as strings rather than
characters.  If a value is assigned (using @samp{=}) to a long option,
@code{*optarg*} is set to the value.  The @samp{=} and value are
not returned as part of the option string.

No information is passed to @code{getopt--} concerning which long
options should be accepted or whether such options can take arguments.
If a long option did not have an argument, @code{*optarg} will be set to
@code{#f}.  The caller is responsible for detecting and reporting
errors.

@example
(define opts ":-:b:")
(define argc 5)
(define argv '("foo" "-b9" "--f1" "--2=" "--g3=35234.342" "--"))
(define *optind* 1)
(define *optarg* #f)
(require 'qp)
@ftindex qp
(do ((i 5 (+ -1 i)))
    ((zero? i))
  (define opt (getopt-- argc argv opts))
  (print *optind* opt *optarg*)))
@print{}
2 #\b "9"
3 "f1" #f
4 "2" ""
5 "g3" "35234.342"

@node Command Line, Parameter lists, Getopt, Programs and Arguments
@subsection Command Line

@code{(require 'read-command)}
@ftindex read-command

@defun read-command port
@defunx read-command
@code{read-command} converts a @dfn{command line} into a list of strings
@cindex command line
suitable for parsing by @code{getopt}.  The syntax of command lines
supported resembles that of popular @dfn{shell}s.  @code{read-command}
updates @var{port} to point to the first character past the command
delimiter.

If an end of file is encountered in the input before any characters are
found that can begin an object or comment, then an end of file object is
returned.

The @var{port} argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
value returned by @code{current-input-port}.

The fields into which the command line is split are delimited by
whitespace as defined by @code{char-whitespace?}.  The end of a command
is delimited by end-of-file or unescaped semicolon (@key{;}) or
@key{newline}.  Any character can be literally included in a field by
escaping it with a backslach (@key{\}).

The initial character and types of fields recognized are:
@table @asis
@item @samp{\}
The next character has is taken literally and not interpreted as a field
delimiter.  If @key{\} is the last character before a @key{newline},
that @key{newline} is just ignored.  Processing continues from the
characters after the @key{newline} as though the backslash and
@key{newline} were not there.
@item @samp{"}
The characters up to the next unescaped @key{"} are taken literally,
according to [R4RS] rules for literal strings (@pxref{Strings, , ,r4rs,
Revised(4) Scheme}).
@item @samp{(}, @samp{%'}
One scheme expression is @code{read} starting with this character.  The
@code{read} expression is evaluated, converted to a string
(using @code{display}), and replaces the expression in the returned
field.
@item @samp{;}
Semicolon delimits a command.  Using semicolons more than one command
can appear on a line.  Escaped semicolons and semicolons inside strings
do not delimit commands.
@end table

@noindent
The comment field differs from the previous fields in that it must be
the first character of a command or appear after whitespace in order to
be recognized.  @key{#} can be part of fields if these conditions are
not met.  For instance, @code{ab#c} is just the field ab#c.

@table @samp
@item #
Introduces a comment.  The comment continues to the end of the line on
which the semicolon appears.  Comments are treated as whitespace by
@code{read-dommand-line} and backslashes before @key{newline}s in
comments are also ignored.
@end table
@end defun

@defun read-options-file filename
@code{read-options-file} converts an @dfn{options file} into a list of
@cindex options file
strings suitable for parsing by @code{getopt}.  The syntax of options
files is the same as the syntax for command
lines, except that @key{newline}s do not terminate reading (only @key{;}
or end of file).

If an end of file is encountered before any characters are found that
can begin an object or comment, then an end of file object is returned.

@subsection Parameter lists

@code{(require 'parameters)}
@ftindex parameters

@noindent
Arguments to procedures in scheme are distinguished from each other by
their position in the procedure call.  This can be confusing when a
procedure takes many arguments, many of which are not often used.

@noindent
A @dfn{parameter-list} is a way of passing named information to a
procedure.  Procedures are also defined to set unused parameters to
default values, check parameters, and combine parameter lists.

@noindent
A @var{parameter} has the form @code{(@r{parameter-name} @r{value1}
@dots{})}.  This format allows for more than one value per
parameter-name.

@noindent
A @var{parameter-list} is a list of @var{parameter}s, each with a
different @var{parameter-name}.

@deffn Function make-parameter-list parameter-names
Returns an empty parameter-list with slots for @var{parameter-names}.
@end deffn

@deffn Function parameter-list-ref parameter-list parameter-name
@var{parameter-name} must name a valid slot of @var{parameter-list}.
@code{parameter-list-ref} returns the value of parameter
@var{parameter-name} of @var{parameter-list}.
@end deffn

@deffn Function remove-parameter parameter-name parameter-list
Removes the parameter @var{parameter-name} from @var{parameter-list}.
@code{remove-parameter} does not alter the argument
@var{parameter-list}.

If there are more than one @var{parameter-name} parameters, an error is
signaled.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure adjoin-parameters! parameter-list parameter1 @dots{}
Returns @var{parameter-list} with @var{parameter1} @dots{} merged in.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure parameter-list-expand expanders parameter-list
@var{expanders} is a list of procedures whose order matches the order of
the @var{parameter-name}s in the call to @code{make-parameter-list}
which created @var{parameter-list}.  For each non-false element of
@var{expanders} that procedure is mapped over the corresponding
parameter value and the returned parameter lists are merged into
@var{parameter-list}.

This process is repeated until @var{parameter-list} stops growing.  The
value returned from @code{parameter-list-expand} is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn Function fill-empty-parameters defaulters parameter-list
@var{defaulters} is a list of procedures whose order matches the order
of the @var{parameter-name}s in the call to @code{make-parameter-list}
which created @var{parameter-list}.  @code{fill-empty-parameters}
returns a new parameter-list with each empty parameter replaced with the
list returned by calling the corresponding @var{defaulter} with
@var{parameter-list} as its argument.
@end deffn

@deffn Function check-parameters checks parameter-list
@var{checks} is a list of procedures whose order matches the order of
the @var{parameter-name}s in the call to @code{make-parameter-list}
which created @var{parameter-list}.

@code{check-parameters} returns @var{parameter-list} if each @var{check}
of the corresponding @var{parameter-list} returns non-false.  If some
@var{check} returns @code{#f} a warning is signaled.
@end deffn

@noindent
In the following procedures @var{arities} is a list of symbols.  The
elements of @code{arities} can be:

@table @code
@item single
Requires a single parameter.
@item optional
A single parameter or no parameter is acceptable.
@item boolean
A single boolean parameter or zero parameters is acceptable.
@item nary
Any number of parameters are acceptable.
@item nary1
One or more of parameters are acceptable.
@end table

@deffn Function parameter-list->arglist positions arities parameter-list
Returns @var{parameter-list} converted to an argument list.  Parameters
of @var{arity} type @code{single} and @code{boolean} are converted to
the single value associated with them.  The other @var{arity} types are
converted to lists of the value(s).

@var{positions} is a list of positive integers whose order matches the
order of the @var{parameter-name}s in the call to
@code{make-parameter-list} which created @var{parameter-list}.  The
integers specify in which argument position the corresponding parameter
should appear.

@node Getopt Parameter lists, Filenames, Parameter lists, Programs and Arguments
@subsection Getopt Parameter lists

@code{(require 'getopt-parameters)}

@deffn Function getopt->parameter-list argc argv optnames arities types aliases desc @dots{}
Returns @var{argv} converted to a parameter-list.  @var{optnames} are
the parameter-names.  @var{arities} and @var{types} are lists of symbols
corresponding to @var{optnames}.

@var{aliases} is a list of lists of strings or integers paired with
elements of @var{optnames}.  Each one-character string will be treated
as a single @samp{-} option by @code{getopt}.  Longer strings will be
treated as long-named options (@pxref{Getopt, getopt--}).

If the @var{aliases} association list has only strings as its
@code{car}s, then all the option-arguments after an option (and before
the next option) are adjoined to that option.

If the @var{aliases} association list has integers, then each (string)
option will take at most one option-argument.  Unoptioned arguments are
collected in a list.  A @samp{-1} alias will take the last argument in
this list; @samp{+1} will take the first argument in the list.  The
aliases -2 then +2; -3 then +3; @dots{} are tried so long as a positive
or negative consecutive alias is found and arguments remain in the list.
Finally a @samp{0} alias, if found, absorbs any remaining arguments.

In all cases, if unclaimed arguments remain after processing, a warning
is signaled and #f is returned.
@end deffn

@deffn Function getopt->arglist argc argv optnames positions arities types defaulters checks aliases desc @dots{}
Like @code{getopt->parameter-list}, but converts @var{argv} to an
argument-list as specified by @var{optnames}, @var{positions},
@var{arities}, @var{types}, @var{defaulters}, @var{checks}, and
@var{aliases}.  If the options supplied violate the @var{arities} or
@var{checks} constraints, then a warning is signaled and #f is returned.

These @code{getopt} functions can be used with SLIB relational

@defun filename:match?? pattern
@defunx filename:match-ci?? pattern
Returns a predicate which returns a non-false value if its string argument
matches (the string) @var{pattern}, false otherwise.  Filename matching
is like
@cindex glob
@dfn{glob} expansion described the bash manpage, except that names
beginning with @samp{.} are matched and @samp{/} characters are not
treated specially.

These functions interpret the following characters specially in
@var{pattern} strings:
@table @samp
@item *
Matches any string, including the null string.
@item ?
Matches any single character.
@item [@dots{}]
Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of characters
separated by a minus sign (-) denotes a range; any character lexically
between those two characters, inclusive, is matched.  If the first
character following the @samp{[} is a @samp{!} or a @samp{^} then any
character not enclosed is matched.  A @samp{-} or @samp{]} may be
matched by including it as the first or last character in the set.
@end table

@example
@end example
@end defun

@defun filename:substitute?? pattern template
@defunx filename:substitute-ci?? pattern template
Returns a function transforming a single string argument according to
glob patterns @var{pattern} and @var{template}.  @var{pattern} and
@var{template} must have the same number of wildcard specifications,
which need not be identical.  @var{pattern} and @var{template} may have
a different number of literal sections. If an argument to the function
matches @var{pattern} in the sense of @code{filename:match??} then it
returns a copy of @var{template} in which each wildcard specification is
replaced by the part of the argument matched by the corresponding
wildcard specification in @var{pattern}.  A @code{*} wildcard matches
the longest leftmost string possible.  If the argument does not match
@var{pattern} then false is returned.

@var{template} may be a function accepting the same number of string
arguments as there are wildcard specifications in @var{pattern}.  In
the case of a match the result of applying @var{template} to a list
of the substrings matched by wildcard specifications will be returned,
otherwise @var{template} will not be called and @code{#f} will be returned.

@example
((filename:substitute?? "scm_[0-9]*.html" "scm5c4_??.htm")

The batch procedures provide a way to write and execute portable scripts
for a variety of operating systems.  Each @code{batch:} procedure takes
as its first argument a parameter-list (@pxref{Parameter lists}).  This

@defun batch:command parms string1 string2 @dots{}
Calls @code{batch:try-command} (below) with arguments, but signals an
error if @code{batch:try-command} returns @code{#f}.
@end defun

@noindent
These functions return a non-false value if the command was successfully
translated into the batch dialect and @code{#f} if not.  In the case of
the @code{system} dialect, the value is non-false if the operation
suceeded.

@defun batch:try-command parms string1 string2 @dots{}
Writes a command to the @code{batch-port} in @var{parms} which executes
the program named @var{string1} with arguments @var{string2} @dots{}.
@end defun

@defun batch:try-chopped-command parms arg1 arg2 @dots{} list
breaks the last argument @var{list} into chunks small enough so that the
command:

@example
@var{arg1} @var{arg2} @dots{} @var{chunk}
@end example

fits withing the platform's maximum command-line length.

@code{batch:try-chopped-command} calls @code{batch:try-command} with the
command and returns non-false only if the commands all fit and
@code{batch:try-command} of each command line returned non-false.
@end defun

@defun batch:run-script parms string1 string2 @dots{}
Writes a command to the @code{batch-port} in @var{parms} which executes
the batch script named @var{string1} with arguments @var{string2}
@dots{}.

@emph{Note:} @code{batch:run-script} and @code{batch:try-command} are not the
same for some operating systems (VMS).
@end defun

@defun batch:comment parms line1 @dots{}
Writes comment lines @var{line1} @dots{} to the @code{batch-port} in
@var{parms}.
@end defun

@defun batch:lines->file parms file line1 @dots{}
Writes commands to the @code{batch-port} in @var{parms} which create a
file named @var{file} with contents @var{line1} @dots{}.
@end defun

@defun batch:delete-file parms file
Writes a command to the @code{batch-port} in @var{parms} which deletes
the file named @var{file}.
@end defun

@defun batch:rename-file parms old-name new-name
Writes a command to the @code{batch-port} in @var{parms} which renames
the file @var{old-name} to @var{new-name}.
@end defun

@noindent
In addition, batch provides some small utilities very useful for writing
scripts:

@defun truncate-up-to path char
@defunx truncate-up-to path string
@defunx truncate-up-to path charlist
@var{path} can be a string or a list of strings.  Returns @var{path}
sans any prefixes ending with a character of the second argument.  This
can be used to derive a filename moved locally from elsewhere.

@example
(truncate-up-to "/usr/local/lib/slib/batch.scm" "/")
@result{} "batch.scm"
@end example
@end defun

@defun string-join joiner string1 @dots{}
Returns a new string consisting of all the strings @var{string1} @dots{}
in order appended together with the string @var{joiner} between each
adjacent pair.
@end defun

@defun must-be-first list1 list2
Returns a new list consisting of the elements of @var{list2} ordered so
that if some elements of @var{list1} are @code{equal?} to elements of
@var{list2}, then those elements will appear first and in the order of
@var{list1}.
@end defun

@defun must-be-last list1 list2
Returns a new list consisting of the elements of @var{list1} ordered so
that if some elements of @var{list2} are @code{equal?} to elements of
@var{list1}, then those elements will appear last and in the order of
@var{list2}.
@end defun

@defun os->batch-dialect osname
Returns its best guess for the @code{batch-dialect} to be used for the
operating-system named @var{osname}.  @code{os->batch-dialect} uses the
tables added to @var{database} by @code{batch:initialize!}.
@end defun

@noindent
Here is an example of the use of most of batch's procedures:

@example
(require 'database-utilities)
@ftindex database-utilities
(require 'parameters)
@ftindex parameters
(require 'batch)
@ftindex batch
(require 'glob)
@ftindex glob

(define batch (create-database #f 'alist-table))

@code{(require 'generic-write)}
@ftindex generic-write

@code{generic-write} is a procedure that transforms a Scheme data value
(or Scheme program expression) into its textual representation and
prints it.  The interface to the procedure is sufficiently general to
easily implement other useful formatting procedures such as pretty
printing, output to a string and truncated output.

@deffn Procedure generic-write obj display? width output
@table @var
@item obj
Scheme data value to transform.
@item display?
Boolean, controls whether characters and strings are quoted.
@item width
Extended boolean, selects format:
@table @asis
@item #f
single line format
@item integer > 0
pretty-print (value = max nb of chars per line)
@end table
@item output
Procedure of 1 argument of string type, called repeatedly with
successive substrings of the textual representation.  This procedure can
return @code{#f} to stop the transformation.
@end table

The value returned by @code{generic-write} is undefined.

Examples:
@lisp
(write obj) @equiv{} (generic-write obj #f #f @var{display-string})

@code{(current-output-port)}.
@end deffn

@defun pprint-filter-file infile proc outfile
@defunx pprint-filter-file infile proc
@var{infile} is a port or a string naming an existing file.  Scheme
source code expressions and definitions are read from the port (or file)
and @var{proc} is applied to them sequentially.

@var{outfile} is a port or a string.  If no @var{outfile} is specified
then @code{current-output-port} is assumed.  These expanded expressions
are then @code{pretty-print}ed to this port.

Whitepsace and comments (introduced by @code{;}) which are not part of

@subsection Time Zone

(require 'time-zone)

@deftp {Data Format} TZ-string

POSIX standards specify several formats for encoding time-zone rules.

@table @t
@item :@i{<pathname>}
If the first character of @i{<pathname>} is @samp{/}, then
@i{<pathname>} specifies the absolute pathname of a tzfile(5) format
time-zone file.  Otherwise, @i{<pathname>} is interpreted as a pathname
within @var{tzfile:vicinity} (/usr/lib/zoneinfo/) naming a tzfile(5)
format time-zone file.
@item @i{<std>}@i{<offset>}
The string @i{<std>} consists of 3 or more alphabetic characters.
@i{<offset>} specifies the time difference from GMT.  The @i{<offset>}
is positive if the local time zone is west of the Prime Meridian and
negative if it is east.  @i{<offset>} can be the number of hours or
hours and minutes (and optionally seconds) separated by @samp{:}.  For
example, @code{-4:30}.
@item @i{<std>}@i{<offset>}@i{<dst>}
@i{<dst>} is the at least 3 alphabetic characters naming the local
daylight-savings-time.
@item @i{<std>}@i{<offset>}@i{<dst>}@i{<doffset>}
@i{<doffset>} specifies the offset from the Prime Meridian when
daylight-savings-time is in effect.
@end table

The non-tzfile formats can optionally be followed by transition times
specifying the day and time when a zone changes from standard to
daylight-savings and back again.

@table @t
@item ,@i{<date>}/@i{<time>},@i{<date>}/@i{<time>}
The @i{<time>}s are specified like the @i{<offset>}s above, except that
leading @samp{+} and @samp{-} are not allowed.

Each @i{<date>} has one of the formats:

@table @t
@item J@i{<day>}
specifies the Julian day with @i{<day>} between 1 and 365.  February 29
is never counted and cannot be referenced.
@item @i{<day>}
This specifies the Julian day with n between 0 and 365.  February 29 is
counted in leap years and can be specified.
@item M@i{<month>}.@i{<week>}.@i{<day>}
This specifies day @i{<day>} (0 <= @i{<day>} <= 6) of week @i{<week>} (1
<= @i{<week>} <= 5) of month @i{<month>} (1 <= @i{<month>} <= 12).  Week
1 is the first week in which day d occurs and week 5 is the last week in
which day @i{<day>} occurs.  Day 0 is a Sunday.

@end table

@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} time-zone
is a datatype encoding how many hours from Greenwich Mean Time the local
time is, and the @dfn{Daylight Savings Time} rules for changing it.
@end deftp

@defun time-zone TZ-string
Creates and returns a time-zone object specified by the string
@var{TZ-string}.  If @code{time-zone} cannot interpret @var{TZ-string},
@code{#f} is returned.
@end defun

@defun tz:params caltime tz
@var{tz} is a time-zone object.  @code{tz:params} returns a list of
three items:
@enumerate 0
@item
An integer.  0 if standard time is in effect for timezone @var{tz} at
@var{caltime}; 1 if daylight savings time is in effect for timezone
@var{tz} at @var{caltime}.
@item
The number of seconds west of the Prime Meridian timezone @var{tz} is at
@var{caltime}.
@item
The name for timezone @var{tz} at @var{caltime}.

@code{tz:params} is unaffected by the default timezone; inquiries can be
made of any timezone at any calendar time.

@noindent
The rest of these procedures and variables are provided for POSIX
compatability.  Because of shared state they are not thread-safe.

@defunx tzset tz
Sets (and returns) the default time-zone to @var{tz}.

@defunx tzset TZ-string
Sets (and returns) the default time-zone to that specified by
@var{TZ-string}.

@code{tzset} also sets the variables @var{*timezone*}, @var{daylight?},
and @var{tzname}.  This function is automatically called by the time
conversion procedures which depend on the time zone (@pxref{Time and
Date}).
@end defun

@defvar *timezone*
Contains the difference, in seconds, between Greenwich Mean Time and
local standard time (for example, in the U.S.  Eastern time zone (EST),
timezone is 5*60*60).  @code{*timezone*} is initialized by @code{tzset}.
@end defvar

@defvar daylight?
is @code{#t} if the default timezone has rules for @dfn{Daylight Savings
Time}.  @emph{Note:} @var{daylight?} does not tell you when Daylight
Savings Time is in effect, just that the default zone sometimes has
Daylight Savings Time.
@end defvar

@code{(require 'logical)}
@ftindex logical

The bit-twiddling functions are made available through the use of the
@code{logical} package.  @code{logical} is loaded by inserting
@code{(require 'logical)} before the code that uses these
@ftindex logical
functions.  These functions behave as though operating on integers
in two's-complement representation.

@subheading Bitwise Operations

@defun logand n1 n1
Returns the integer which is the bit-wise AND of the two integer
arguments.

Example:
@lisp
(number->string (logand #b1100 #b1010) 2)
   @result{} "1000"
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun logior n1 n2
Returns the integer which is the bit-wise OR of the two integer
arguments.

Example:
@lisp
(number->string (logior #b1100 #b1010) 2)
   @result{} "1110"
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun logxor n1 n2
Returns the integer which is the bit-wise XOR of the two integer
arguments.

Example:
@lisp
(number->string (logxor #b1100 #b1010) 2)
   @result{} "110"
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun lognot n
Returns the integer which is the 2s-complement of the integer argument.

Example:
@lisp
(number->string (lognot #b10000000) 2)
   @result{} "-10000001"
(number->string (lognot #b0) 2)
   @result{} "-1"
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun bitwise-if mask n0 n1
Returns an integer composed of some bits from integer @var{n0} and some
from integer @var{n1}.  A bit of the result is taken from @var{n0} if the
corresponding bit of integer @var{mask} is 1 and from @var{n1} if that bit
of @var{mask} is 0.
@end defun

@defun logtest j k
@example
(logtest j k) @equiv{} (not (zero? (logand j k)))

(logtest #b0100 #b1011) @result{} #f
(logtest #b0100 #b0111) @result{} #t
@end example
@end defun

@defun logcount n
Returns the number of bits in integer @var{n}.  If integer is positive,
the 1-bits in its binary representation are counted.  If negative, the
0-bits in its two's-complement binary representation are counted.  If 0,
0 is returned.

Example:
@lisp
(logcount #b10101010)
   @result{} 4
(logcount 0)
   @result{} 0
(logcount -2)
   @result{} 1
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun logbit? index j
@example
(logbit? index j) @equiv{} (logtest (integer-expt 2 index) j)

(logbit? 0 #b1101) @result{} #t
(logbit? 1 #b1101) @result{} #f
(logbit? 2 #b1101) @result{} #t
(logbit? 3 #b1101) @result{} #t
(logbit? 4 #b1101) @result{} #f
@end example
@end defun

@defun copy-bit index from bit
Returns an integer the same as @var{from} except in the @var{index}th bit,
which is 1 if @var{bit} is @code{#t} and 0 if @var{bit} is @code{#f}.

Example:
@example
(number->string (copy-bit 0 0 #t) 2)       @result{} "1"
(number->string (copy-bit 2 0 #t) 2)       @result{} "100"
(number->string (copy-bit 2 #b1111 #f) 2)  @result{} "1011"
@end example
@end defun

@subheading Fields of Bits

@defun bit-field n start end
@findex bit-extract
Returns the integer composed of the @var{start} (inclusive) through
@var{end} (exclusive) bits of @var{n}.  The @var{start}th bit becomes
the 0-th bit in the result.

This function was called @code{bit-extract} in previous versions of SLIB.
@refill

Example:
@lisp
(number->string (bit-field #b1101101010 0 4) 2)
   @result{} "1010"
(number->string (bit-field #b1101101010 4 9) 2)
   @result{} "10110"
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun copy-bit-field to start end from
Returns an integer the same as @var{to} except possibly in the
@var{start} (inclusive) through @var{end} (exclusive) bits, which are
the same as those of @var{from}.  The 0-th bit of @var{from} becomes the
@var{start}th bit of the result.

Example:
@example
(number->string (copy-bit-field #b1101101010 0 4 0) 2)
        @result{} "1101100000"
(number->string (copy-bit-field #b1101101010 0 4 -1) 2)
        @result{} "1101101111"
@end example
@end defun

@defun ash int count
Returns an integer equivalent to
@code{(inexact->exact (floor (* @var{int} (expt 2 @var{count}))))}.

Example:
@lisp
(number->string (ash #b1 3) 2)

@defun modular:normalize modulus n
Returns the integer @code{(modulo @var{n} (modulus->integer
@var{modulus}))} in the representation specified by @var{modulus}.
@end defun

@noindent
The rest of these functions assume normalized arguments; That is, the
arguments are constrained by the following table:

@noindent
For all of these functions, if the first argument (@var{modulus}) is:
@table @code
@item positive?
Work as before.  The result is between 0 and @var{modulus}.

@item zero?
The arguments are treated as integers.  An integer is returned.

@item negative?
The arguments and result are treated as members of the integers modulo
@code{(+ 1 (* -2 @var{modulus}))}, but with @dfn{symmetric}
representation; i.e. @code{(<= (- @var{modulus}) @var{n}

@noindent
If all the arguments are fixnums the computation will use only fixnums.

@defun modular:invertable? modulus k
Returns @code{#t} if there exists an integer n such that @var{k} * n
@equiv{} 1 mod @var{modulus}, and @code{#f} otherwise.
@end defun

@defun modular:invert modulus k2
Returns an integer n such that 1 = (n * @var{k2}) mod @var{modulus}.  If
@var{k2} has no inverse mod @var{modulus} an error is signaled.

A pseudo-random number generator is only as good as the tests it passes.
George Marsaglia of Florida State University developed a battery of

@file{diehard.c} has a bug which the patch
@url{http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/ftpdir/users/jaffer/diehard.c.pat} corrects.

SLIB's new PRNG generates 8 bits at a time.  With the degenerate seed
@samp{0}, the numbers generated pass DIEHARD; but when bits are combined
from sequential bytes, tests fail.  With the seed
@samp{http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html}, all of those tests
pass.

@section Cyclic Checksum

@code{(require 'make-crc)}
@ftindex make-crc

@defun make-port-crc
@defunx make-port-crc degree
Returns an expression for a procedure of one argument, a port.  This
procedure reads characters from the port until the end of file and
returns the integer checksum of the bytes read.

The integer @var{degree}, if given, specifies the degree of the
polynomial being computed -- which is also the number of bits computed
in the checksums.  The default value is 32.

@defunx make-port-crc generator

The integer @var{generator} specifies the polynomial being computed.
The power of 2 generating each 1 bit is the exponent of a term of the
polynomial.  The value of @var{generator} must be larger than 127.

@defunx make-port-crc degree generator

The integer @var{generator} specifies the polynomial being computed.
The power of 2 generating each 1 bit is the exponent of a term of the
polynomial.  The bit at position @var{degree} is implicit and should not
be part of @var{generator}.  This allows systems with numbers limited to
32 bits to calculate 32 bit checksums.  The default value of
@var{generator} when @var{degree} is 32 (its default) is:

@example
(make-port-crc 32 #b00000100110000010001110110110111)
@end example

Creates a procedure to calculate the P1003.2/D11.2 (POSIX.2) 32-bit
checksum from the polynomial:

@example
     32    26    23    22    16    12    11

@end example
then the root returned will be between @var{x0} and @var{x1}, and

The secant method is used until a bracketing interval is found, at which point
a modified @i{regula falsi} method is used.

If @var{prec} is instead a negative integer, @code{secant:find-root}
returns the result of -@var{prec} iterations.

If @var{prec} is a procedure it should accept 5 arguments: @var{x0}

@section Commutative Rings

Scheme provides a consistent and capable set of numeric functions.
Inexacts implement a field; integers a commutative ring (and Euclidean
domain).  This package allows one to use basic Scheme numeric functions
with symbols and non-numeric elements of commutative rings.

@code{(require 'commutative-ring)}
@ftindex commutative-ring
@cindex ring, commutative

The @dfn{commutative-ring} package makes the procedures @code{+},
@code{-}, @code{*}, @code{/}, and @code{^} @dfn{careful} in the sense
@cindex careful
that any non-numeric arguments they do not reduce appear in the
expression output.  In order to see what working with this package is
like, self-set all the single letter identifiers (to their corresponding
symbols).

@example
(define a 'a)
@dots{}
(define z 'z)
@end example

Or just @code{(require 'self-set)}.  Now try some sample expressions:

@example
(+ (+ a b) (- a b)) @result{} (* a 2)
(* (+ a b) (+ a b)) @result{} (^ (+ a b) 2)
(* (+ a b) (- a b)) @result{} (* (+ a b) (- a b))
(* (- a b) (- a b)) @result{} (^ (- a b) 2)
(* (- a b) (+ a b)) @result{} (* (+ a b) (- a b))
(/ (+ a b) (+ c d)) @result{} (/ (+ a b) (+ c d))
(^ (+ a b) 3) @result{} (^ (+ a b) 3)
(^ (+ a 2) 3) @result{} (^ (+ 2 a) 3)
@end example

Associative rules have been applied and repeated addition and
multiplication converted to multiplication and exponentiation.

We can enable distributive rules, thus expanding to sum of products
form:
@example
(set! *ruleset* (combined-rulesets distribute* distribute/))

(* (+ a b) (+ a b)) @result{} (+ (* 2 a b) (^ a 2) (^ b 2))
(* (+ a b) (- a b)) @result{} (- (^ a 2) (^ b 2))
(* (- a b) (- a b)) @result{} (- (+ (^ a 2) (^ b 2)) (* 2 a b))
(* (- a b) (+ a b)) @result{} (- (^ a 2) (^ b 2))
(/ (+ a b) (+ c d)) @result{} (+ (/ a (+ c d)) (/ b (+ c d)))
(/ (+ a b) (- c d)) @result{} (+ (/ a (- c d)) (/ b (- c d)))
(/ (- a b) (- c d)) @result{} (- (/ a (- c d)) (/ b (- c d)))
(/ (- a b) (+ c d)) @result{} (- (/ a (+ c d)) (/ b (+ c d)))
(^ (+ a b) 3) @result{} (+ (* 3 a (^ b 2)) (* 3 b (^ a 2)) (^ a 3) (^ b 3))
(^ (+ a 2) 3) @result{} (+ 8 (* a 12) (* (^ a 2) 6) (^ a 3))
@end example

Use of this package is not restricted to simple arithmetic expressions:

@example
(require 'determinant)

(determinant '((a b c) (d e f) (g h i))) @result{}
(- (+ (* a e i) (* b f g) (* c d h)) (* a f h) (* b d i) (* c e g))
@end example

Currently, only @code{+}, @code{-}, @code{*}, @code{/}, and @code{^}
support non-numeric elements.  Expressions with @code{-} are converted
to equivalent expressions without @code{-}, so behavior for @code{-} is
not defined separately.  @code{/} expressions are handled similarly.

This list might be extended to include @code{quotient}, @code{modulo},
@code{remainder}, @code{lcm}, and @code{gcd}; but these work only for
the more restrictive Euclidean (Unique Factorization) Domain.
@cindex Unique Factorization
@cindex Euclidean Domain

@heading Rules and Rulesets

The @dfn{commutative-ring} package allows control of ring properties
through the use of @dfn{rulesets}.

@defvar *ruleset*
Contains the set of rules currently in effect.  Rules defined by
@code{cring:define-rule} are stored within the value of *ruleset* at the
time @code{cring:define-rule} is called.  If @var{*ruleset*} is
@code{#f}, then no rules apply.
@end defvar

@defun make-ruleset rule1 @dots{}
@defunx make-ruleset name rule1 @dots{}
Returns a new ruleset containing the rules formed by applying
@code{cring:define-rule} to each 4-element list argument @var{rule}.  If
the first argument to @code{make-ruleset} is a symbol, then the database
table created for the new ruleset will be named @var{name}.  Calling
@code{make-ruleset} with no rule arguments creates an empty ruleset.
@end defun

@defun combined-rulesets ruleset1 @dots{}
@defunx combined-rulesets name ruleset1 @dots{}
Returns a new ruleset containing the rules contained in each ruleset
argument @var{ruleset}.  If the first argument to
@code{combined-ruleset} is a symbol, then the database table created for
the new ruleset will be named @var{name}.  Calling
@code{combined-ruleset} with no ruleset arguments creates an empty
ruleset.
@end defun

Two rulesets are defined by this package.

@defvr Constant distribute*
Contain the ruleset to distribute multiplication over addition and
subtraction.
@defvrx Constant distribute/
Contain the ruleset to distribute division over addition and
subtraction.

Take care when using both @var{distribute*} and @var{distribute/}
simultaneously.  It is possible to put @code{/} into an infinite loop.
@end defvr

You can specify how sum and product expressions containing non-numeric
elements simplify by specifying the rules for @code{+} or @code{*} for
cases where expressions involving objects reduce to numbers or to
expressions involving different non-numeric elements.

@defun cring:define-rule op sub-op1 sub-op2 reduction
Defines a rule for the case when the operation represented by symbol
@var{op} is applied to lists whose @code{car}s are @var{sub-op1} and
@var{sub-op2}, respectively.  The argument @var{reduction} is a
procedure accepting 2 arguments which will be lists whose @code{car}s
are @var{sub-op1} and @var{sub-op2}.

@defunx cring:define-rule op sub-op1 'identity reduction
Defines a rule for the case when the operation represented by symbol
@var{op} is applied to a list whose @code{car} is @var{sub-op1}, and
some other argument.  @var{Reduction} will be called with the list whose
@code{car} is @var{sub-op1} and some other argument.

If @var{reduction} returns @code{#f}, the reduction has failed and other
reductions will be tried.  If @var{reduction} returns a non-false value,
that value will replace the two arguments in arithmetic (@code{+},
@code{-}, and @code{*}) calculations involving non-numeric elements.

The operations @code{+} and @code{*} are assumed commutative; hence both
orders of arguments to @var{reduction} will be tried if necessary.

The following rule is the definition for distributing @code{*} over
@code{+}.

@example
(cring:define-rule
 '* '+ 'identity
 (lambda (exp1 exp2)
   (apply + (map (lambda (trm) (* trm exp2)) (cdr exp1))))))
@end example
@end defun

@heading How to Create a Commutative Ring

The first step in creating your commutative ring is to write procedures
to create elements of the ring.  A non-numeric element of the ring must
be represented as a list whose first element is a symbol or string.
This first element identifies the type of the object.  A convenient and
clear convention is to make the type-identifying element be the same
symbol whose top-level value is the procedure to create it.

@example
(define (n . list1)
  (cond ((and (= 2 (length list1))
              (eq? (car list1) (cadr list1)))
         0)
        ((not (term< (first list1) (last1 list1)))
         (apply n (reverse list1)))
        (else (cons 'n list1))))

(define (s x y) (n x y))

(define (m . list1)
  (cond ((neq? (first list1) (term_min list1))
         (apply m (cyclicrotate list1)))
        ((term< (last1 list1) (cadr list1))
         (apply m (reverse (cyclicrotate list1))))
        (else (cons 'm list1))))
@end example

Define a procedure to multiply 2 non-numeric elements of the ring.
Other multiplicatons are handled automatically.  Objects for which rules
have @emph{not} been defined are not changed.

@example
(define (n*n ni nj)
  (let ((list1 (cdr ni)) (list2 (cdr nj)))
    (cond ((null? (intersection list1 list2)) #f)
          ((and (eq? (last1 list1) (first list2))
                (neq? (first list1) (last1 list2)))
           (apply n (splice list1 list2)))
          ((and (eq? (first list1) (first list2))
                (neq? (last1 list1) (last1 list2)))
           (apply n (splice (reverse list1) list2)))
          ((and (eq? (last1 list1) (last1 list2))
                (neq? (first list1) (first list2)))
           (apply n (splice list1 (reverse list2))))
          ((and (eq? (last1 list1) (first list2))
                (eq? (first list1) (last1 list2)))
           (apply m (cyclicsplice list1 list2)))
          ((and (eq? (first list1) (first list2))
                (eq? (last1 list1) (last1 list2)))
           (apply m (cyclicsplice (reverse list1) list2)))
          (else #f))))
@end example

Test the procedures to see if they work.

@example
;;; where cyclicrotate(list) is cyclic rotation of the list one step
;;; by putting the first element at the end
(define (cyclicrotate list1)
  (append (rest list1) (list (first list1))))
;;; and where term_min(list) is the element of the list which is
;;; first in the term ordering.
(define (term_min list1)
  (car (sort list1 term<)))
(define (term< sym1 sym2)
  (string<? (symbol->string sym1) (symbol->string sym2)))
(define first car)
(define rest cdr)
(define (last1 list1) (car (last-pair list1)))
(define (neq? obj1 obj2) (not (eq? obj1 obj2)))
;;; where splice is the concatenation of list1 and list2 except that their
;;; common element is not repeated.
(define (splice list1 list2)
  (cond ((eq? (last1 list1) (first list2))
         (append list1 (cdr list2)))
        (else (error 'splice list1 list2))))
;;; where cyclicsplice is the result of leaving off the last element of
;;; splice(list1,list2).
(define (cyclicsplice list1 list2)
  (cond ((and (eq? (last1 list1) (first list2))
              (eq? (first list1) (last1 list2)))
         (butlast (splice list1 list2) 1))
        (else (error 'cyclicsplice list1 list2))))

(N*N (S a b) (S a b)) @result{} (m a b)
@end example

Then register the rule for multiplying type N objects by type N objects.

@example
(cring:define-rule '* 'N 'N N*N))
@end example

Now we are ready to compute!

@example
(define (t)
  (define detM
    (+ (* (S g b)
          (+ (* (S f d)
                (- (* (S a f) (S d g)) (* (S a g) (S d f))))
             (* (S f f)
                (- (* (S a g) (S d d)) (* (S a d) (S d g))))
             (* (S f g)
                (- (* (S a d) (S d f)) (* (S a f) (S d d))))))
       (* (S g d)
          (+ (* (S f b)
                (- (* (S a g) (S d f)) (* (S a f) (S d g))))
             (* (S f f)
                (- (* (S a b) (S d g)) (* (S a g) (S d b))))
             (* (S f g)
                (- (* (S a f) (S d b)) (* (S a b) (S d f))))))
       (* (S g f)
          (+ (* (S f b)
                (- (* (S a d) (S d g)) (* (S a g) (S d d))))
             (* (S f d)
                (- (* (S a g) (S d b)) (* (S a b) (S d g))))
             (* (S f g)
                (- (* (S a b) (S d d)) (* (S a d) (S d b))))))
       (* (S g g)
          (+ (* (S f b)
                (- (* (S a f) (S d d)) (* (S a d) (S d f))))
             (* (S f d)

@section Base Table

A base table implementation using Scheme association lists is available
as the value of the identifier @code{alist-table} after doing:

@code{(require 'alist-table)}
@ftindex alist-table


Association list base tables are suitable for small databases and
support all Scheme types when temporary and readable/writeable Scheme
types when saved.  I hope support for other base table implementations
will be added in the future.

This rest of this section documents the interface for a base table
implementation from which the @ref{Relational Database} package
constructs a Relational system.  It will be of interest primarily to
those wishing to port or write new base-table implementations.

All of these functions are accessed through a single procedure by
calling that procedure with the symbol name of the operation.  A
procedure will be returned if that operation is supported and @code{#f}
otherwise.  For example:

@example
@group
(require 'alist-table)
@ftindex alist-table
(define open-base (alist-table 'make-base))
make-base       @result{} *a procedure*
(define foo (alist-table 'foo))
foo             @result{} #f
@end group
@end example

@defun make-base filename key-dimension column-types
Returns a new, open, low-level database (collection of tables)
associated with @var{filename}.  This returned database has an empty
table associated with @var{catalog-id}.  The positive integer
@var{key-dimension} is the number of keys composed to make a
@var{primary-key} for the catalog table.  The list of symbols
@var{column-types} describes the types of each column for that table.
If the database cannot be created as specified, @code{#f} is returned.

Calling the @code{close-base} method on this database and possibly other
operations will cause @var{filename} to be written to.  If
@var{filename} is @code{#f} a temporary, non-disk based database will be
created if such can be supported by the base table implelentation.
@end defun

@defun open-base filename mutable
Returns an open low-level database associated with @var{filename}.  If
@var{mutable?} is @code{#t}, this database will have methods capable of
effecting change to the database.  If @var{mutable?} is @code{#f}, only
methods for inquiring the database will be available.  If the database
cannot be opened as specified @code{#f} is returned.

Calling the @code{close-base} (and possibly other) method on a
@var{mutable?}  database will cause @var{filename} to be written to.
@end defun

@defun write-base lldb filename
Causes the low-level database @var{lldb} to be written to
@var{filename}.  If the write is successful, also causes @var{lldb} to
henceforth be associated with @var{filename}.  Calling the
@code{close-database} (and possibly other) method on @var{lldb} may
cause @var{filename} to be written to.  If @var{filename} is @code{#f}
this database will be changed to a temporary, non-disk based database if
such can be supported by the underlying base table implelentation.  If
the operations completed successfully, @code{#t} is returned.
Otherwise, @code{#f} is returned.
@end defun

@defun sync-base lldb
Causes the file associated with the low-level database @var{lldb} to be
updated to reflect its current state.  If the associated filename is
@code{#f}, no action is taken and @code{#f} is returned.  If this
operation completes successfully, @code{#t} is returned.  Otherwise,
@code{#f} is returned.
@end defun

@defun close-base lldb
Causes the low-level database @var{lldb} to be written to its associated
file (if any).  If the write is successful, subsequent operations to
@var{lldb} will signal an error.  If the operations complete
successfully, @code{#t} is returned.  Otherwise, @code{#f} is returned.
@end defun

@defun make-table lldb key-dimension column-types
Returns the @var{base-id} for a new base table, otherwise returns
@code{#f}.  The base table can then be opened using @code{(open-table
@var{lldb} @var{base-id})}.  The positive integer @var{key-dimension} is
the number of keys composed to make a @var{primary-key} for this table.
The list of symbols @var{column-types} describes the types of each
column.
@end defun

@defvr Constant catalog-id
A constant @var{base-id} suitable for passing as a parameter to
@code{open-table}.  @var{catalog-id} will be used as the base table for
the system catalog.
@end defvr

@defun open-table lldb base-id key-dimension column-types
Returns a @var{handle} for an existing base table in the low-level
database @var{lldb} if that table exists and can be opened in the mode
indicated by @var{mutable?}, otherwise returns @code{#f}.

As with @code{make-table}, the positive integer @var{key-dimension} is
the number of keys composed to make a @var{primary-key} for this table.
The list of symbols @var{column-types} describes the types of each
column.
@end defun

@defun kill-table lldb base-id key-dimension column-types
Returns @code{#t} if the base table associated with @var{base-id} was
removed from the low level database @var{lldb}, and @code{#f} otherwise.
@end defun

@defun make-keyifier-1 type
Returns a procedure which accepts a single argument which must be of
type @var{type}.  This returned procedure returns an object suitable for
being a @var{key} argument in the functions whose descriptions follow.

Any 2 arguments of the supported type passed to the returned function
which are not @code{equal?} must result in returned values which are not
@code{equal?}.
@end defun

@defun make-list-keyifier key-dimension types
The list of symbols @var{types} must have at least @var{key-dimension}
elements.  Returns a procedure which accepts a list of length
@var{key-dimension} and whose types must corresopond to the types named
by @var{types}.  This returned procedure combines the elements of its
list argument into an object suitable for being a @var{key} argument in
the functions whose descriptions follow.

Any 2 lists of supported types (which must at least include symbols and
non-negative integers) passed to the returned function which are not
@code{equal?} must result in returned values which are not
@code{equal?}.
@end defun

@defun make-key-extractor key-dimension types column-number
Returns a procedure which accepts objects produced by application of the
result of @code{(make-list-keyifier @var{key-dimension} @var{types})}.
This procedure returns a @var{key} which is @code{equal?} to the
@var{column-number}th element of the list which was passed to create
@var{combined-key}.  The list @var{types} must have at least
@var{key-dimension} elements.
@end defun

@defun make-key->list key-dimension types
Returns a procedure which accepts objects produced by application of the
result of @code{(make-list-keyifier @var{key-dimension} @var{types})}.
This procedure returns a list of @var{key}s which are elementwise
@code{equal?} to the list which was passed to create @var{combined-key}.
@end defun

@noindent
In the following functions, the @var{key} argument can always be assumed
to be the value returned by a call to a @emph{keyify} routine.

@noindent
@cindex match-keys
@cindex match
@cindex wild-card
In contrast, a @var{match-keys} argument is a list of length equal to
the number of primary keys.  The @var{match-keys} restrict the actions
of the table command to those records whose primary keys all satisfy the
corresponding element of the @var{match-keys} list.  The elements and
their actions are:

@quotation
@table @asis
@item @code{#f}
The false value matches any key in the corresponding position.
@item an object of type procedure
This procedure must take a single argument, the key in the corresponding
position.  Any key for which the procedure returns a non-false value is
a match; Any key for which the procedure returns a @code{#f} is not.
@item other values
Any other value matches only those keys @code{equal?} to it.
@end table
@end quotation

@noindent
The @var{key-dimension} and @var{column-types} arguments are needed to
decode the combined-keys for matching with @var{match-keys}.

@defun for-each-key handle procedure key-dimension column-types match-keys
Calls @var{procedure} once with each @var{key} in the table opened in
@var{handle} which satisfy @var{match-keys} in an unspecified order.
An unspecified value is returned.
@end defun

@defun map-key handle procedure key-dimension column-types match-keys
Returns a list of the values returned by calling @var{procedure} once
with each @var{key} in the table opened in @var{handle} which satisfy
@var{match-keys} in an unspecified order.
@end defun

@defun ordered-for-each-key handle procedure key-dimension column-types match-keys
Calls @var{procedure} once with each @var{key} in the table opened in
@var{handle} which satisfy @var{match-keys} in the natural order for
the types of the primary key fields of that table.  An unspecified value
is returned.
@end defun

@defun delete* handle key-dimension column-types match-keys
Removes all rows which satisfy @var{match-keys} from the table opened in
@var{handle}.  An unspecified value is returned.
@end defun

@defun present? handle key
Returns a non-@code{#f} value if there is a row associated with
@var{key} in the table opened in @var{handle} and @code{#f} otherwise.
@end defun

@defun delete handle key
Removes the row associated with @var{key} from the table opened in
@var{handle}.  An unspecified value is returned.
@end defun

@defun make-getter key-dimension types
Returns a procedure which takes arguments @var{handle} and @var{key}.
This procedure returns a list of the non-primary values of the relation
(in the base table opened in @var{handle}) whose primary key is
@var{key} if it exists, and @code{#f} otherwise.
@end defun

@defun make-putter key-dimension types
Returns a procedure which takes arguments @var{handle} and @var{key} and
@var{value-list}.  This procedure associates the primary key @var{key}
with the values in @var{value-list} (in the base table opened in
@var{handle}) and returns an unspecified value.
@end defun

@defun supported-type? symbol
Returns @code{#t} if @var{symbol} names a type allowed as a column value
by the implementation, and @code{#f} otherwise.  At a minimum, an
implementation must support the types @code{integer}, @code{symbol},
@code{string}, @code{boolean}, and @code{base-id}.
@end defun

@defun supported-key-type? symbol
Returns @code{#t} if @var{symbol} names a type allowed as a key value by
the implementation, and @code{#f} otherwise.  At a minimum, an
implementation must support the types @code{integer}, and @code{symbol}.
@end defun

@table @code
@item integer
Scheme exact integer.
@item symbol
Scheme symbol.
@item boolean
@code{#t} or @code{#f}.
@item base-id
Objects suitable for passing as the @var{base-id} parameter to
@code{open-table}.  The value of @var{catalog-id} must be an acceptable
@code{base-id}.
@end table

@node Motivations, Creating and Opening Relational Databases, Relational Database, Relational Database
@subsection Motivations

Most nontrivial programs contain databases: Makefiles, configure
scripts, file backup, calendars, editors, source revision control, CAD
systems, display managers, menu GUIs, games, parsers, debuggers,
profilers, and even error reporting are all rife with databases.  Coding
databases is such a common activity in programming that many may not be
aware of how often they do it.

A database often starts as a dispatch in a program.  The author, perhaps
because of the need to make the dispatch configurable, the need for
correlating dispatch in other routines, or because of changes or growth,
devises a data structure to contain the information, a routine for
interpreting that data structure, and perhaps routines for augmenting
and modifying the stored data.  The dispatch must be converted into this
form and tested.

The programmer may need to devise an interactive program for enabling
easy examination and modification of the information contained in this
database.  Often, in an attempt to foster modularity and avoid delays in
release, intermediate file formats for the database information are
devised.  It often turns out that users prefer modifying these
intermediate files with a text editor to using the interactive program
in order to do operations (such as global changes) not forseen by the
program's author.

In order to address this need, the conscientious software engineer may
even provide a scripting language to allow users to make repetitive
database changes.  Users will grumble that they need to read a large
manual and learn yet another programming language (even if it
@emph{almost} has language "xyz" syntax) in order to do simple
configuration.

All of these facilities need to be designed, coded, debugged,
documented, and supported; often causing what was very simple in concept
to become a major developement project.

This view of databases just outlined is somewhat the reverse of the view
of the originators of the @dfn{Relational Model} of database
abstraction.  The relational model was devised to unify and allow
interoperation of large multi-user databases running on diverse
platforms.  A fairly general purpose "Comprehensive Language" for
database manipulations is mandated (but not specified) as part of the
relational model for databases.

One aspect of the Relational Model of some importance is that the
"Comprehensive Language" must be expressible in some form which can be
stored in the database.  This frees the programmer from having to make
programs data-driven in order to use a database.

This package includes as one of its basic supported types Scheme
@dfn{expression}s.  This type allows expressions as defined by the
Scheme standards to be stored in the database.  Using @code{slib:eval}
retrieved expressions can be evaluated (in the top-level environment).
Scheme's @code{lambda} facilitates closure of environments, modularity,
etc. so that procedures (which could not be stored directly most
databases) can still be effectively retrieved.  Since @code{slib:eval}
evaluates expressions in the top-level environment, built-in and user
defined procedures can be easily accessed by name.

This package's purpose is to standardize (through a common interface)
database creation and usage in Scheme programs.  The relational model's
provision for inclusion of language expressions as data as well as the
description (in tables, of course) of all of its tables assures that
relational databases are powerful enough to assume the roles currently
played by thousands of ad-hoc routines and data formats.

@noindent
Such standardization to a relational-like model brings many benefits:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Tables, fields, domains, and types can be dealt with by name in
programs.
@item
The underlying database implementation can be changed (for
performance or other reasons) by changing a single line of code.
@item
The formats of tables can be easily extended or changed without
altering code.
@item
Consistency checks are specified as part of the table descriptions.
Changes in checks need only occur in one place.
@item
All the configuration information which the developer wishes to group
together is easily grouped, without needing to change programs aware of
only some of these tables.
@item
Generalized report generators, interactive entry programs, and other
database utilities can be part of a shared library.  The burden of
adding configurability to a program is greatly reduced.
@item
Scheme is the "comprehensive language" for these databases.  Scripting
for configuration no longer needs to be in a separate language with
additional documentation.
@item
Scheme's latent types mesh well with the strict typing and logical
requirements of the relational model.
@item
Portable formats allow easy interchange of data.  The included table
descriptions help prevent misinterpretation of format.

@subsection Creating and Opening Relational Databases

@defun make-relational-system base-table-implementation

Returns a procedure implementing a relational database using the
@var{base-table-implementation}.

All of the operations of a base table implementation are accessed
through a procedure defined by @code{require}ing that implementation.
Similarly, all of the operations of the relational database
implementation are accessed through the procedure returned by
@code{make-relational-system}.  For instance, a new relational database
could be created from the procedure returned by
@code{make-relational-system} by:

@example
(require 'alist-table)
@ftindex alist-table
(define relational-alist-system
        (make-relational-system alist-table))
(define create-alist-database
        (relational-alist-system 'create-database))
(define my-database
        (create-alist-database "mydata.db"))
@end example
@end defun

@noindent
What follows are the descriptions of the methods available from
relational system returned by a call to @code{make-relational-system}.

@defun create-database filename

Returns an open, nearly empty relational database associated with
@var{filename}.  The only tables defined are the system catalog and
domain table.  Calling the @code{close-database} method on this database
and possibly other operations will cause @var{filename} to be written
to.  If @var{filename} is @code{#f} a temporary, non-disk based database
will be created if such can be supported by the underlying base table
implelentation.  If the database cannot be created as specified
@code{#f} is returned.  For the fields and layout of descriptor tables,
@ref{Catalog Representation}
@end defun

@defun open-database filename mutable?

Returns an open relational database associated with @var{filename}.  If
@var{mutable?} is @code{#t}, this database will have methods capable of
effecting change to the database.  If @var{mutable?} is @code{#f}, only
methods for inquiring the database will be available.  Calling the
@code{close-database} (and possibly other) method on a @var{mutable?}
database will cause @var{filename} to be written to.  If the database
cannot be opened as specified @code{#f} is returned.
@end defun

@node Relational Database Operations, Table Operations, Creating and Opening Relational Databases, Relational Database
@subsection Relational Database Operations

@noindent
These are the descriptions of the methods available from an open
relational database.  A method is retrieved from a database by calling
the database with the symbol name of the operation.  For example:

@example
(define my-database
        (create-alist-database "mydata.db"))
(define telephone-table-desc
        ((my-database 'create-table) 'telephone-table-desc))
@end example

@defun close-database
Causes the relational database to be written to its associated file (if
any).  If the write is successful, subsequent operations to this
database will signal an error.  If the operations completed
successfully, @code{#t} is returned.  Otherwise, @code{#f} is returned.
@end defun

@defun write-database filename
Causes the relational database to be written to @var{filename}.  If the
write is successful, also causes the database to henceforth be
associated with @var{filename}.  Calling the @code{close-database} (and
possibly other) method on this database will cause @var{filename} to be
written to.  If @var{filename} is @code{#f} this database will be
changed to a temporary, non-disk based database if such can be supported
by the underlying base table implelentation.  If the operations
completed successfully, @code{#t} is returned.  Otherwise, @code{#f} is
returned.
@end defun

@defun sync-database
Causes any pending updates to the database file to be written out.  If
the operations completed successfully, @code{#t} is returned.
Otherwise, @code{#f} is returned.
@end defun

@defun table-exists? table-name
Returns @code{#t} if @var{table-name} exists in the system catalog,
otherwise returns @code{#f}.
@end defun

@defun open-table table-name mutable?
Returns a @dfn{methods} procedure for an existing relational table in
this database if it exists and can be opened in the mode indicated by
@var{mutable?}, otherwise returns @code{#f}.
@end defun

@noindent
These methods will be present only in databases which are

@subsection Table Operations

@noindent
These are the descriptions of the methods available from an open
relational table.  A method is retrieved from a table by calling
the table with the symbol name of the operation.  For example:

@example
@group
(define telephone-table-desc
        ((my-database 'create-table) 'telephone-table-desc))
(require 'common-list-functions)
(define ndrp (telephone-table-desc 'row:insert))
(ndrp '(1 #t name #f string))
(ndrp '(2 #f telephone
          (lambda (d)

                  (string->list d))))
          string))
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Some operations described below require primary key arguments.  Primary
keys arguments are denoted @var{key1} @var{key2} @dots{}.  It is an
error to call an operation for a table which takes primary key arguments
with the wrong number of primary keys for that table.

@noindent
The term @dfn{row} used below refers to a Scheme list of values (one for
each column) in the order specified in the descriptor (table) for this
table.  Missing values appear as @code{#f}.  Primary keys must not
be missing.

@defun get column-name
Returns a procedure of arguments @var{key1} @var{key2} @dots{} which
returns the value for the @var{column-name} column of the row associated
with primary keys @var{key1}, @var{key2} @dots{} if that row exists in
the table, or @code{#f} otherwise.

@example
((plat 'get 'processor) 'djgpp) @result{} i386
((plat 'get 'processor) 'be-os) @result{} #f
@end example

@defunx get* column-name
Returns a procedure of optional arguments @var{match-key1} @dots{} which
returns a list of the values for the specified column for all rows in
this table.  The optional @var{match-key1} @dots{} arguments restrict
actions to a subset of the table.  See the match-key description below
for details.

@defun row:remove
Returns a procedure of arguments @var{key1} @var{key2} @dots{} which
removes and returns the row associated with primary keys @var{key1},

@defunx row:remove*
Returns a procedure of optional arguments @var{match-key1} @dots{} which

@dots{} if it exists.  The value returned is unspecified.

@defunx row:delete*

@end defun

@defun row:update
Returns a procedure of one argument, @var{row}, which adds the row,
@var{row}, to this table.  If a row for the primary key(s) specified by
@var{row} already exists in this table, it will be overwritten.  The
value returned is unspecified.

@defunx row:update*
Returns a procedure of one argument, @var{rows}, which adds each row in
the list of rows, @var{rows}, to this table.  If a row for the primary
key specified by an element of @var{rows} already exists in this table,
it will be overwritten.  The value returned is unspecified.
@end defun

@defun row:insert
Adds the row @var{row} to this table.  If a row for the primary key(s)

@defun for-each-row
Returns a procedure of arguments @var{proc} @var{match-key1} @dots{}
which calls @var{proc} with each @var{row} in this table in the
(implementation-dependent) natural ordering for rows.  The optional
@var{match-key1} @dots{} arguments restrict actions to a subset of the

@emph{Real} relational programmers would use some least-upper-bound join
for every row to get them in order; But we don't have joins yet.
@end defun

@noindent
@cindex match-keys
The (optional) @var{match-key1} @dots{} arguments are used to restrict
actions of a whole-table operation to a subset of that table.  Those
procedures (returned by methods) which accept match-key arguments will
accept any number of match-key arguments between zero and the number of
primary keys in the table.  Any unspecified @var{match-key} arguments
default to @code{#f}.

@noindent
The @var{match-key1} @dots{} restrict the actions of the table command
to those records whose primary keys each satisfy the corresponding
@var{match-key} argument.  The arguments and their actions are:

@quotation
@table @asis
@item @code{#f}
The false value matches any key in the corresponding position.
@item an object of type procedure
This procedure must take a single argument, the key in the corresponding
position.  Any key for which the procedure returns a non-false value is
a match; Any key for which the procedure returns a @code{#f} is not.
@item other values
Any other value matches only those keys @code{equal?} to it.
@end table

@defun close-table
Subsequent operations to this table will signal an error.
@end defun

@defvr Constant column-names
@defvrx Constant column-foreigns
@defvrx Constant column-domains
@defvrx Constant column-types
Return a list of the column names, foreign-key table names, domain
names, or type names respectively for this table.  These 4 methods are
different from the others in that the list is returned, rather than a
procedure to obtain the list.

@defvrx Constant primary-limit
Returns the number of primary keys fields in the relations in this
table.

@node Catalog Representation, Unresolved Issues, Table Operations, Relational Database
@subsection Catalog Representation

@noindent
Each database (in an implementation) has a @dfn{system catalog} which
describes all the user accessible tables in that database (including
itself).

@noindent
The system catalog base table has the following fields.  @code{PRI}
indicates a primary key for that table.

@example
@group
PRI table-name
    column-limit            the highest column number
    coltab-name             descriptor table name
    bastab-id               data base table identifier
    user-integrity-rule
    view-procedure          A scheme thunk which, when called,
                            produces a handle for the view.  coltab
                            and bastab are specified if and only if
                            view-procedure is not.
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Descriptors for base tables (not views) are tables (pointed to by
system catalog).  Descriptor (base) tables have the fields:

@example
@group
PRI column-number           sequential integers from 1
    primary-key?            boolean TRUE for primary key components
    column-name
    column-integrity-rule
    domain-name
@end group
@end example

@noindent
A @dfn{primary key} is any column marked as @code{primary-key?} in the
corresponding descriptor table.  All the @code{primary-key?} columns
must have lower column numbers than any non-@code{primary-key?} columns.
Every table must have at least one primary key.  Primary keys must be
sufficient to distinguish all rows from each other in the table.  All of
the system defined tables have a single primary key.

@noindent
This package currently supports tables having from 1 to 4 primary keys
if there are non-primary columns, and any (natural) number if @emph{all}
columns are primary keys.  If you need more than 4 primary keys, I would
like to hear what you are doing!

@noindent
A @dfn{domain} is a category describing the allowable values to occur in
a column.  It is described by a (base) table with the fields:

@example
@group
PRI domain-name
    foreign-table
    domain-integrity-rule
    type-id
    type-param
@end group
@end example

@noindent
The @dfn{type-id} field value is a symbol.  This symbol may be used by
the underlying base table implementation in storing that field.

@noindent
If the @code{foreign-table} field is non-@code{#f} then that field names
a table from the catalog.  The values for that domain must match a
primary key of the table referenced by the @var{type-param} (or
@code{#f}, if allowed).  This package currently does not support
composite foreign-keys.

@noindent
The types for which support is planned are:
@example
@group
    atom
    symbol
    string                  [<length>]
    number                  [<base>]
    money                   <currency>
    date-time
    boolean

    foreign-key             <table-name>
    expression
    virtual                 <expression>
@end group
@end example

@node Unresolved Issues, Database Utilities, Catalog Representation, Relational Database
@subsection Unresolved Issues

Although @file{rdms.scm} is not large, I found it very difficult to
write (six rewrites).  I am not aware of any other examples of a
generalized relational system (although there is little new in CS).  I
left out several aspects of the Relational model in order to simplify
the job.  The major features lacking (which might be addressed portably)
are views, transaction boundaries, and protection.

Protection needs a model for specifying priveledges.  Given how
operations are accessed from handles it should not be difficult to
restrict table accesses to those allowed for that user.

The system catalog has a field called @code{view-procedure}.  This
should allow a purely functional implementation of views.  This will
work but is unsatisfying for views resulting from a @dfn{select}ion
(subset of rows); for whole table operations it will not be possible to
reduce the number of keys scanned over when the selection is specified
only by an opaque procedure.

Transaction boundaries present the most intriguing area.  Transaction
boundaries are actually a feature of the "Comprehensive Language" of the
Relational database and not of the database.  Scheme would seem to
provide the opportunity for an extremely clean semantics for transaction
boundaries since the builtin procedures with side effects are small in
number and easily identified.

These side-effect builtin procedures might all be portably redefined to
versions which properly handled transactions.  Compiled library routines
would need to be recompiled as well.  Many system extensions
(delete-file, system, etc.) would also need to be redefined.

@noindent
There are 2 scope issues that must be resolved for multiprocess
transaction boundaries:

@table @asis
@item Process scope
The actions captured by a transaction should be only for the process
which invoked the start of transaction.  Although standard Scheme does
not provide process primitives as such, @code{dynamic-wind} would
provide a workable hook into process switching for many implementations.
@item Shared utilities with state
Some shared utilities have state which should @emph{not} be part of a
transaction.  An example would be calling a pseudo-random number
generator.  If the success of a transaction depended on the
pseudo-random number and failed, the state of the generator would be set
back.  Subsequent calls would keep returning the same number and keep
failing.

Pseudo-random number generators are not reentrant; thus they would
require locks in order to operate properly in a multiprocess
environment.  Are all examples of utilities whose state should not be
part of transactions also non-reentrant?  If so, perhaps suspending
transaction capture for the duration of locks would solve this problem.

associated with @var{filename}.
@end defun

@defun open-database filename
@defunx open-database filename base-table-type
Returns an open enchanced relational database associated with
@var{filename}.  The database will be opened with base-table type
@var{base-table-type}) if supplied.  If @var{base-table-type} is not
supplied, @code{open-database} will attempt to deduce the correct
base-table-type.  If the database can not be opened or if it lacks the
@code{*commands*} table, @code{#f} is returned.

@defunx open-database! filename
@defunx open-database! filename base-table-type
Returns @emph{mutable} open enchanced relational database @dots{}
@end defun

@noindent
The table @code{*commands*} in an @dfn{enhanced} relational-database has
the fields (with domains):
@example
@group
PRI name        symbol
    parameters  parameter-list
    procedure   expression
    documentation string
@end group
@end example

The @code{parameters} field is a foreign key (domain
@code{parameter-list}) of the @code{*catalog-data*} table and should
have the value of a table described by @code{*parameter-columns*}.  This
@code{parameter-list} table describes the arguments suitable for passing
to the associated command.  The intent of this table is to be of a form
such that different user-interfaces (for instance, pull-down menus or
plain-text queries) can operate from the same table.  A
@code{parameter-list} table has the following fields:
@example
@group
PRI index       uint
    name        symbol
    arity       parameter-arity
    domain      domain
    defaulter   expression
    expander    expression
    documentation string
@end group
@end example

The @code{arity} field can take the values:

@table @code
@item single
Requires a single parameter of the specified domain.
@item optional
A single parameter of the specified domain or zero parameters is
acceptable.
@item boolean
A single boolean parameter or zero parameters (in which case @code{#f}
is substituted) is acceptable.
@item nary
Any number of parameters of the specified domain are acceptable.  The
argument passed to the command function is always a list of the
parameters.
@item nary1
One or more of parameters of the specified domain are acceptable.  The
argument passed to the command function is always a list of the
parameters.
@end table

The @code{domain} field specifies the domain which a parameter or
parameters in the @code{index}th field must satisfy.

The @code{defaulter} field is an expression whose value is either
@code{#f} or a procedure of one argument (the parameter-list) which
returns a @emph{list} of the default value or values as appropriate.
Note that since the @code{defaulter} procedure is called every time a
default parameter is needed for this column, @dfn{sticky} defaults can
be implemented using shared state with the domain-integrity-rule.

@subsubheading Invoking Commands

When an enhanced relational-database is called with a symbol which
matches a @var{name} in the @code{*commands*} table, the associated
procedure expression is evaluated and applied to the enhanced
relational-database.  A procedure should then be returned which the user
can invoke on (optional) arguments.

The command @code{*initialize*} is special.  If present in the
@code{*commands*} table, @code{open-database} or @code{open-database!}
will return the value of the @code{*initialize*} command.  Notice that
arbitrary code can be run when the @code{*initialize*} procedure is
automatically applied to the enhanced relational-database.

Note also that if you wish to shadow or hide from the user
relational-database methods described in @ref{Relational Database
Operations}, this can be done by a dispatch in the closure returned by
the @code{*initialize*} expression rather than by entries in the
@code{*commands*} table if it is desired that the underlying methods
remain accessible to code in the @code{*commands*} table.

@defun make-command-server rdb table-name
Returns a procedure of 2 arguments, a (symbol) command and a call-back
procedure.  When this returned procedure is called, it looks up
@var{command} in table @var{table-name} and calls the call-back
procedure with arguments:
@table @var
@item command
The @var{command}
@item command-value
The result of evaluating the expression in the @var{procedure} field of
@var{table-name} and calling it with @var{rdb}.
@item parameter-name
A list of the @dfn{official} name of each parameter.  Corresponds to the
@code{name} field of the @var{command}'s parameter-table.
@item positions
A list of the positive integer index of each parameter.  Corresponds to
the @code{index} field of the @var{command}'s parameter-table.
@item arities
A list of the arities of each parameter.  Corresponds to the
@code{arity} field of the @var{command}'s parameter-table.  For a
description of @code{arity} see table above.

@defun add-domain domain-row
Adds @var{domain-row} to the @dfn{domains} table if there is no row in
the domains table associated with key @code{(car @var{domain-row})} and
returns @code{#t}.  Otherwise returns @code{#f}.

For the fields and layout of the domain table, @xref{Catalog

@itemize @bullet
@item
domain-name
@item
foreign-table
@item
domain-integrity-rule
@item
type-id
@item

@end itemize

The following example adds 3 domains to the @samp{build} database.
@samp{Optstring} is either a string or @code{#f}.  @code{filename} is a
string and @code{build-whats} is a symbol.

@example
(for-each (build 'add-domain)

@subsubheading Defining Tables

@deffn Procedure define-tables rdb spec-0 @dots{}
Adds tables as specified in @var{spec-0} @dots{} to the open

@lisp
(@r{<name>} @r{<descriptor-name>} @r{<descriptor-name>} @r{<rows>})
@end lisp
or
@lisp
(@r{<name>} @r{<primary-key-fields>} @r{<other-fields>} @r{<rows>})
@end lisp

where @r{<name>} is the table name, @r{<descriptor-name>} is the symbol
name of a descriptor table, @r{<primary-key-fields>} and
@r{<other-fields>} describe the primary keys and other fields
respectively, and @r{<rows>} is a list of data rows to be added to the
table.

@r{<primary-key-fields>} and @r{<other-fields>} are lists of field
descriptors of the form:

@lisp
(@r{<column-name>} @r{<domain>})
@end lisp
or
@lisp
(@r{<column-name>} @r{<domain>} @r{<column-integrity-rule>})
@end lisp

where @r{<column-name>} is the column name, @r{<domain>} is the domain
of the column, and @r{<column-integrity-rule>} is an expression whose
value is a procedure of one argument (which returns @code{#f} to signal
an error).

If @r{<domain>} is not a defined domain name and it matches the name of
this table or an already defined (in one of @var{spec-0} @dots{}) single
key field table, a foriegn-key domain will be created for it.

Code for generating database reports is in @file{report.scm}.  After
writing it using @code{format}, I discovered that Common-Lisp
@code{format} is not useable for this application because there is no
mechanismm for truncating fields.  @file{report.scm} needs to be
rewritten using @code{printf}.

@deffn Procedure create-report rdb destination report-name table
@deffnx Procedure create-report rdb destination report-name
The symbol @var{report-name} must be primary key in the table named
@code{*reports*} in the relational database @var{rdb}.
@var{destination} is a port, string, or symbol.  If @var{destination} is
a:

@table @asis
@item port
The table is created as ascii text and written to that port.
@item string
The table is created as ascii text and written to the file named by
@var{destination}.
@item symbol
@var{destination} is the primary key for a row in the table named *printers*.
@end table

The report is prepared as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{Format} (@pxref{Format}) is called with the @code{header} field
and the (list of) @code{column-names} of the table.
@item
@code{Format} is called with the @code{reporter} field and (on
successive calls) each record in the natural order for the table.  A
count is kept of the number of newlines output by format.  When the
number of newlines to be output exceeds the number of lines per page,
the set of lines will be broken if there are more than
@code{minimum-break} left on this page and the number of lines for this
row is larger or equal to twice @code{minimum-break}.
@item
@code{Format} is called with the @code{footer} field and the (list of)
@code{column-names} of the table.  The footer field should not output a
newline.
@item
A new page is output.
@item
This entire process repeats until all the rows are output.
@end itemize
@end deffn

Each row in the table *reports* has the fields:

@table @asis
@item name
The report name.
@item default-table
The table to report on if none is specified.
@item header, footer
A @code{format} string.  At the beginning and end of each page
respectively, @code{format} is called with this string and the (list of)
column-names of this table.
@item reporter
A @code{format} string.  For each row in the table, @code{format} is
called with this string and the row.
@item minimum-break
The minimum number of lines into which the report lines for a row can be
broken.  Use @code{0} if a row's lines should not be broken over page
boundaries.

@section Weight-Balanced Trees

@code{(require 'wt-tree)}
@ftindex wt-tree

@cindex trees, balanced binary
@cindex balanced binary trees
@cindex binary trees
@cindex weight-balanced binary trees
Balanced binary trees are a useful data structure for maintaining large
sets of ordered objects or sets of associations whose keys are ordered.
MIT Scheme has an comprehensive implementation of weight-balanced binary
trees which has several advantages over the other data structures for
large aggregates:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In addition to the usual element-level operations like insertion,
deletion and lookup, there is a full complement of collection-level
operations, like set intersection, set union and subset test, all of
which are implemented with good orders of growth in time and space.
This makes weight balanced trees ideal for rapid prototyping of
functionally derived specifications.

@item
An element in a tree may be indexed by its position under the ordering
of the keys, and the ordinal position of an element may be determined,
both with reasonable efficiency.

@item
Operations to find and remove minimum element make weight balanced trees
simple to use for priority queues.

@item
The implementation is @emph{functional} rather than @emph{imperative}.
This means that operations like `inserting' an association in a tree do
not destroy the old tree, in much the same way that @code{(+ 1 x)}
modifies neither the constant 1 nor the value bound to @code{x}.  The
trees are referentially transparent thus the programmer need not worry
about copying the trees.  Referential transparency allows space
efficiency to be achieved by sharing subtrees.

@end itemize

These features make weight-balanced trees suitable for a wide range of
applications, especially those that
require large numbers of sets or discrete maps.  Applications that have
a few global databases and/or concentrate on element-level operations like
insertion and lookup are probably better off using hash-tables or
red-black trees.

The @emph{size} of a tree is the number of associations that it
contains.  Weight balanced binary trees are balanced to keep the sizes
of the subtrees of each node within a constant factor of each other.
This ensures logarithmic times for single-path operations (like lookup
and insertion).  A weight balanced tree takes space that is proportional
to the number of associations in the tree.  For the current
implementation, the constant of proportionality is six words per
association.

@cindex binary trees, as sets
@cindex binary trees, as discrete maps
@cindex sets, using binary trees
@cindex discrete maps, using binary trees
Weight balanced trees can be used as an implementation for either
discrete sets or discrete maps (associations).  Sets are implemented by
ignoring the datum that is associated with the key.  Under this scheme
if an associations exists in the tree this indicates that the key of the
association is a member of the set.  Typically a value such as
@code{()}, @code{#t} or @code{#f} is associated with the key.

Many operations can be viewed as computing a result that, depending on
whether the tree arguments are thought of as sets or maps, is known by
two different names.  An example is @code{wt-tree/member?}, which, when
regarding the tree argument as a set, computes the set membership
operation, but, when regarding the tree as a discrete map,
@code{wt-tree/member?} is the predicate testing if the map is defined at
an element in its domain.  Most names in this package have been chosen
based on interpreting the trees as sets, hence the name
@code{wt-tree/member?} rather than @code{wt-tree/defined-at?}.


@cindex run-time-loadable option
@cindex option, run-time-loadable
The weight balanced tree implementation is a run-time-loadable option.
To use weight balanced trees, execute

@example
(load-option 'wt-tree)
@end example
@findex load-option

@noindent
once before calling any of the procedures defined here.

@node Construction of Weight-Balanced Trees, Basic Operations on Weight-Balanced Trees, Weight-Balanced Trees, Weight-Balanced Trees
@subsection Construction of Weight-Balanced Trees

Binary trees require there to be a total order on the keys used to
arrange the elements in the tree.  Weight balanced trees are organized
by @emph{types}, where the type is an object encapsulating the ordering
relation.  Creating a tree is a two-stage process.  First a tree type
must be created from the predicate which gives the ordering.  The tree
type is then used for making trees, either empty or singleton trees or
trees from other aggregate structures like association lists.  Once
created, a tree `knows' its type and the type is used to test
compatibility between trees in operations taking two trees.  Usually a
small number of tree types are created at the beginning of a program and
used many times throughout the program's execution.

@deffn {procedure+} make-wt-tree-type key<?
This procedure creates and returns a new tree type based on the ordering
predicate @var{key<?}.
@var{Key<?} must be a total ordering, having the property that for all
key values @code{a}, @code{b} and @code{c}:

@example
(key<? a a)                         @result{} #f
(and (key<? a b) (key<? b a))       @result{} #f
(if (and (key<? a b) (key<? b c))
    (key<? a c)
    #t)                             @result{} #t
@end example

@noindent
Two key values are assumed to be equal if neither is less than the other
by @var{key<?}.

Each call to @code{make-wt-tree-type} returns a distinct value, and
trees are only compatible if their tree types are @code{eq?}.  A
consequence is that trees that are intended to be used in binary tree
operations must all be created with a tree type originating from the
same call to @code{make-wt-tree-type}.
@end deffn

@defvr {variable+} number-wt-type
A standard tree type for trees with numeric keys.  @code{Number-wt-type}
could have been defined by

@example
(define number-wt-type (make-wt-tree-type  <))
@end example
@end defvr

@defvr {variable+} string-wt-type

@example
(define string-wt-type (make-wt-tree-type  string<?))
@end example
@end defvr



@deffn {procedure+} make-wt-tree wt-tree-type
This procedure creates and returns a newly allocated weight balanced
tree.  The tree is empty, i.e. it contains no associations.
@var{Wt-tree-type} is a weight balanced tree type obtained by calling
@code{make-wt-tree-type}; the returned tree has this type.
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} singleton-wt-tree wt-tree-type key datum
This procedure creates and returns a newly allocated weight balanced
tree.  The tree contains a single association, that of @var{datum} with
@var{key}.  @var{Wt-tree-type} is a weight balanced tree type obtained
by calling @code{make-wt-tree-type}; the returned tree has this type.
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} alist->wt-tree tree-type alist
Returns a newly allocated weight-balanced tree that contains the same
associations as @var{alist}.  This procedure is equivalent to:

This section describes the basic tree operations on weight balanced
trees.  These operations are the usual tree operations for insertion,
deletion and lookup, some predicates and a procedure for determining the
number of associations in a tree.

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree? object
Returns @code{#t} if @var{object} is a weight-balanced tree, otherwise

Returns the number of associations in @var{wt-tree}, an exact
non-negative integer.  This operation takes constant time.
@end deffn


@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/add wt-tree key datum
Returns a new tree containing all the associations in @var{wt-tree} and
the association of @var{datum} with @var{key}.  If @var{wt-tree} already
had an association for @var{key}, the new association overrides the old.
The average and worst-case times required by this operation are
proportional to the logarithm of the number of associations in
@var{wt-tree}.
@end deffn

Associates @var{datum} with @var{key} in @var{wt-tree} and returns an
unspecified value.  If @var{wt-tree} already has an association for
@var{key}, that association is replaced.  The average and worst-case
times required by this operation are proportional to the logarithm of
the number of associations in @var{wt-tree}.
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/member? key wt-tree
Returns @code{#t} if @var{wt-tree} contains an association for

@subsection Advanced Operations on Weight-Balanced Trees

In the following the @emph{size} of a tree is the number of associations
that the tree contains, and a @emph{smaller} tree contains fewer
associations.

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/split< wt-tree bound
Returns a new tree containing all and only the associations in
@var{wt-tree} which have a key that is less than @var{bound} in the
ordering relation of the tree type of @var{wt-tree}.  The average and
worst-case times required by this operation are proportional to the
logarithm of the size of @var{wt-tree}.
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/split> wt-tree bound
Returns a new tree containing all and only the associations in
@var{wt-tree} which have a key that is greater than @var{bound} in the
ordering relation of the tree type of @var{wt-tree}.  The average and
worst-case times required by this operation are proportional to the
logarithm of size of @var{wt-tree}.
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/union wt-tree-1 wt-tree-2
Returns a new tree containing all the associations from both trees.
This operation is asymmetric: when both trees have an association for
the same key, the returned tree associates the datum from @var{wt-tree-2}
with the key.  Thus if the trees are viewed as discrete maps then
@code{wt-tree/union} computes the map override of @var{wt-tree-1} by
@var{wt-tree-2}.  If the trees are viewed as sets the result is the set
union of the arguments.
The worst-case time required by this operation
is proportional to the sum of the sizes of both trees.
If the minimum key of one tree is greater than the maximum key of
the other tree then the time required is at worst proportional to
the logarithm of the size of the larger tree.
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/intersection wt-tree-1 wt-tree-2
Returns a new tree containing all and only those associations from
@var{wt-tree-1} which have keys appearing as the key of an association
in @var{wt-tree-2}.  Thus the associated data in the result are those
from @var{wt-tree-1}.  If the trees are being used as sets the result is
the set intersection of the arguments.  As a discrete map operation,
@code{wt-tree/intersection} computes the domain restriction of
@var{wt-tree-1} to (the domain of) @var{wt-tree-2}.
The time required by this operation is never worse that proportional to
the sum of the sizes of the trees.
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/difference wt-tree-1 wt-tree-2
Returns a new tree containing all and only those associations from
@var{wt-tree-1} which have keys that @emph{do not} appear as the key of
an association in @var{wt-tree-2}.  If the trees are viewed as sets the
result is the asymmetric set difference of the arguments.  As a discrete
map operation, it computes the domain restriction of @var{wt-tree-1} to
the complement of (the domain of) @var{wt-tree-2}.
The time required by this operation is never worse that proportional to
the sum of the sizes of the trees.
@end deffn


@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/subset? wt-tree-1 wt-tree-2
Returns @code{#t} iff the key of each association in @var{wt-tree-1} is
the key of some association in @var{wt-tree-2}, otherwise returns @code{#f}.
Viewed as a set operation, @code{wt-tree/subset?} is the improper subset
predicate.
A proper subset predicate can be constructed:

@example
(define (proper-subset? s1 s2)
  (and (wt-tree/subset? s1 s2)
       (< (wt-tree/size s1) (wt-tree/size s2))))
@end example

As a discrete map operation, @code{wt-tree/subset?} is the subset
test on the domain(s) of the map(s).  In the worst-case the time
required by this operation is proportional to the size of
@var{wt-tree-1}.
@end deffn


@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/set-equal? wt-tree-1 wt-tree-2
Returns @code{#t} iff for every association in @var{wt-tree-1} there is
an association in @var{wt-tree-2} that has the same key, and @emph{vice
versa}.

Viewing the arguments as sets @code{wt-tree/set-equal?} is the set
equality predicate.  As a map operation it determines if two maps are
defined on the same domain.

This procedure is equivalent to

@example
(lambda (wt-tree-1 wt-tree-2)
  (and (wt-tree/subset? wt-tree-1 wt-tree-2
       (wt-tree/subset? wt-tree-2 wt-tree-1)))
@end example

In the worst-case the time required by this operation is proportional to
the size of the smaller tree.
@end deffn


@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/fold combiner initial wt-tree
This procedure reduces @var{wt-tree} by combining all the associations,
using an reverse in-order traversal, so the associations are visited in
reverse order.  @var{Combiner} is a procedure of three arguments: a key,
a datum and the accumulated result so far.  Provided @var{combiner}
takes time bounded by a constant, @code{wt-tree/fold} takes time
proportional to the size of @var{wt-tree}.

A sorted association list can be derived simply:

@example
(wt-tree/fold  (lambda (key datum list)
                 (cons (cons key datum) list))
               '()
               @var{wt-tree}))
@end example

The data in the associations can be summed like this:

@example
(wt-tree/fold  (lambda (key datum sum) (+ sum datum))
               0
               @var{wt-tree})
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/for-each action wt-tree
This procedure traverses the tree in-order, applying @var{action} to
each association.
The associations are processed in increasing order of their keys.
@var{Action} is a procedure of two arguments which take the key and
datum respectively of the association.
Provided @var{action} takes time bounded by a constant,
@code{wt-tree/for-each} takes time proportional to in the size of
@var{wt-tree}.
The example prints the tree:

@example
(wt-tree/for-each (lambda (key value)
                    (display (list key value)))
                  @var{wt-tree}))
@end example
@end deffn


@node Indexing Operations on Weight-Balanced Trees,  , Advanced Operations on Weight-Balanced Trees, Weight-Balanced Trees
@subsection Indexing Operations on Weight-Balanced Trees

Weight balanced trees support operations that view the tree as sorted
sequence of associations.  Elements of the sequence can be accessed by
position, and the position of an element in the sequence can be
determined, both in logarthmic time.

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/index wt-tree index
@deffnx {procedure+} wt-tree/index-datum wt-tree index
@deffnx {procedure+} wt-tree/index-pair wt-tree index
Returns the 0-based @var{index}th association of @var{wt-tree} in the
sorted sequence under the tree's ordering relation on the keys.
@code{wt-tree/index} returns the @var{index}th key,
@code{wt-tree/index-datum} returns the datum associated with the
@var{index}th key and @code{wt-tree/index-pair} returns a new pair
@code{(@var{key} . @var{datum})} which is the @code{cons} of the
@var{index}th key and its datum.  The average and worst-case times
required by this operation are proportional to the logarithm of the
number of associations in the tree.

These operations signal an error if the tree is empty, if
@var{index}@code{<0}, or if @var{index} is greater than or equal to the
number of associations in the tree.

Indexing can be used to find the median and maximum keys in the tree as
follows:

@example
median:   (wt-tree/index @var{wt-tree}
                         (quotient (wt-tree/size @var{wt-tree}) 2))

maximum:  (wt-tree/index @var{wt-tree}
                         (-1+ (wt-tree/size @var{wt-tree})))
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/rank wt-tree key
Determines the 0-based position of @var{key} in the sorted sequence of
the keys under the tree's ordering relation, or @code{#f} if the tree
has no association with for @var{key}.  This procedure returns either an
exact non-negative integer or @code{#f}.  The average and worst-case
times required by this operation are proportional to the logarithm of
the number of associations in the tree.
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/min wt-tree
@deffnx {procedure+} wt-tree/min-datum wt-tree
@deffnx {procedure+} wt-tree/min-pair wt-tree
Returns the association of @var{wt-tree} that has the least key under
the tree's ordering relation.  @code{wt-tree/min} returns the least key,
@code{wt-tree/min-datum} returns the datum associated with the least key
and @code{wt-tree/min-pair} returns a new pair @code{(key . datum)}
which is the @code{cons} of the minimum key and its datum.  The average
and worst-case times required by this operation are proportional to the
logarithm of the number of associations in the tree.

These operations signal an error if the tree is empty.
They could be written
@example
(define (wt-tree/min tree)        (wt-tree/index tree 0))
(define (wt-tree/min-datum tree)  (wt-tree/index-datum tree 0))
(define (wt-tree/min-pair tree)   (wt-tree/index-pair tree 0))
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/delete-min wt-tree
Returns a new tree containing all of the associations in @var{wt-tree}
except the association with the least key under the @var{wt-tree}'s
ordering relation.  An error is signalled if the tree is empty.  The
average and worst-case times required by this operation are proportional
to the logarithm of the number of associations in the tree.  This
operation is equivalent to

@example
(wt-tree/delete @var{wt-tree} (wt-tree/min @var{wt-tree}))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn {procedure+} wt-tree/delete-min! wt-tree
Removes the association with the least key under the @var{wt-tree}'s
ordering relation.  An error is signalled if the tree is empty.  The
average and worst-case times required by this operation are proportional
to the logarithm of the number of associations in the tree.  This
operation is equivalent to

@example
(wt-tree/delete! @var{wt-tree} (wt-tree/min @var{wt-tree}))
@end example

@subsection Arrays

@code{(require 'array)}
@ftindex array

@defun array? obj
Returns @code{#t} if the @var{obj} is an array, and @code{#f} if not.
@end defun

@defun make-array initial-value bound1 bound2 @dots{}
Creates and returns an array that has as many dimensins as there are
@var{bound}s and fills it with @var{initial-value}.
@end defun

When constructing an array, @var{bound} is either an inclusive range of
indices expressed as a two element list, or an upper bound expressed as
a single integer.  So@refill
@lisp
(make-array 'foo 3 3) @equiv{} (make-array 'foo '(0 2) '(0 2))
@end lisp

@defun make-shared-array array mapper bound1 bound2 @dots{}
@code{make-shared-array} can be used to create shared subarrays of other
arrays.  The @var{mapper} is a function that translates coordinates in
the new array into coordinates in the old array.  A @var{mapper} must be
linear, and its range must stay within the bounds of the old array, but
it can be otherwise arbitrary.  A simple example:@refill
@lisp
(define fred (make-array #f 8 8))
(define freds-diagonal
  (make-shared-array fred (lambda (i) (list i i)) 8))
(array-set! freds-diagonal 'foo 3)
(array-ref fred 3 3)
   @result{} FOO
(define freds-center
  (make-shared-array fred (lambda (i j) (list (+ 3 i) (+ 3 j)))
                     2 2))
(array-ref freds-center 0 0)
   @result{} FOO
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun array-rank obj
Returns the number of dimensions of @var{obj}.  If @var{obj} is not an
array, 0 is returned.
@end defun

@defun array-shape array
@code{array-shape} returns a list of inclusive bounds.  So:
@lisp
(array-shape (make-array 'foo 3 5))
   @result{} ((0 2) (0 4))
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun array-dimensions array
@code{array-dimensions} is similar to @code{array-shape} but replaces
elements with a 0 minimum with one greater than the maximum. So:
@lisp
(array-dimensions (make-array 'foo 3 5))
   @result{} (3 5)
@end lisp
@end defun

@deffn Procedure array-in-bounds? array index1 index2 @dots{}
Returns @code{#t} if its arguments would be acceptable to
@code{array-ref}.
@end deffn

@defun array-ref array index1 index2 @dots{}
Returns the element at the @code{(@var{index1}, @var{index2})} element
in @var{array}.
@end defun

@deffn Procedure array-set! array new-value index1 index2 @dots{}
@end deffn

@defun array-1d-ref array index
@defunx array-2d-ref array index1 index2
@defunx array-3d-ref array index1 index2 index3
@end defun

@deffn Procedure array-1d-set! array new-value index
@deffnx Procedure array-2d-set! array new-value index1 index2
@deffnx Procedure array-3d-set! array new-value index1 index2 index3
@end deffn

The functions are just fast versions of @code{array-ref} and
@code{array-set!} that take a fixed number of arguments, and perform no
bounds checking.

If you comment out the bounds checking code, this is about as efficient
as you could ask for without help from the compiler.

An exercise left to the reader: implement the rest of APL.

@end defun

@defun array-for-each @var{proc} @var{array0} @dots{}
@var{proc} is applied to each tuple of elements of @var{array0} @dots{}
in row-major order.  The value returned is unspecified.

@var{li} (apply array-ref (array-indexes @var{array}) @var{li})).
@end defun

@defun array-index-map! array proc
applies @var{proc} to the indices of each element of @var{array} in
turn, storing the result in the corresponding element.  The value
returned and the order of application are unspecified.

One can implement @var{array-indexes} as
@example

      (array-index-map! v (lambda (i) i))
      v))
@end example
@end defun

@defun array-copy! source destination
Copies every element from vector or array @var{source} to the
corresponding element of @var{destination}.  @var{destination} must have
the same rank as @var{source}, and be at least as large in each
dimension.  The order of copying is unspecified.

@node Association Lists, Byte, Array Mapping, Data Structures
@subsection Association Lists

@code{(require 'alist)}
@ftindex alist

Alist functions provide utilities for treating a list of key-value pairs
as an associative database.  These functions take an equality predicate,
@var{pred}, as an argument.  This predicate should be repeatable,
symmetric, and transitive.

Alist functions can be used with a secondary index method such as hash
tables for improved performance.

@defun predicate->asso pred
Returns an @dfn{association function} (like @code{assq}, @code{assv}, or
@code{assoc}) corresponding to @var{pred}.  The returned function
returns a key-value pair whose key is @code{pred}-equal to its first
argument or @code{#f} if no key in the alist is @var{pred}-equal to the
first argument.
@end defun

@defun alist-inquirer pred
Returns a procedure of 2 arguments, @var{alist} and @var{key}, which
returns the value associated with @var{key} in @var{alist} or @code{#f} if
@var{key} does not appear in @var{alist}.
@end defun

@defun alist-associator pred
Returns a procedure of 3 arguments, @var{alist}, @var{key}, and
@var{value}, which returns an alist with @var{key} and @var{value}
associated.  Any previous value associated with @var{key} will be
lost.  This returned procedure may or may not have side effects on its
@var{alist} argument.  An example of correct usage is:@refill
@lisp
(define put (alist-associator string-ci=?))
(define alist '())
(set! alist (put alist "Foo" 9))
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun alist-remover pred
Returns a procedure of 2 arguments, @var{alist} and @var{key}, which
returns an alist with an association whose @var{key} is key removed.
This returned procedure may or may not have side effects on its
@var{alist} argument.  An example of correct usage is:@refill
@lisp
(define rem (alist-remover string-ci=?))
(set! alist (rem alist "foo"))
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun alist-map proc alist
Returns a new association list formed by mapping @var{proc} over the

arguments which returns the new value part.
@end defun

@defun alist-for-each proc alist
Applies @var{proc} to each pair of keys and values of @var{alist}.
@var{proc} must be a function of 2 arguments.  The returned value is

@dfn{elements} indexed by corresponding @dfn{keys}, although the keys
may be implicit (as with lists).

New types of collections may be defined as YASOS objects (@pxref{Yasos}).
They must support the following operations:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{(collection? @var{self})} (always returns @code{#t});

@item
@code{(size @var{self})} returns the number of elements in the collection;

@item
@code{(print @var{self} @var{port})} is a specialized print operation
for the collection which prints a suitable representation on the given
@var{port} or returns it as a string if @var{port} is @code{#t};@refill

@item
@code{(gen-elts @var{self})} returns a thunk which on successive
invocations yields elements of @var{self} in order or gives an error if
it is invoked more than @code{(size @var{self})} times;@refill

@item
@code{(gen-keys @var{self})} is like @code{gen-elts}, but yields the
collection's keys in order.

@end itemize
They might support specialized @code{for-each-key} and
@code{for-each-elt} operations.

@defun collection? obj
A predicate, true initially of lists, vectors and strings.  New sorts of
collections must answer @code{#t} to @code{collection?}.
@end defun

@deffn Procedure map-elts proc . collections
@deffnx Procedure do-elts proc . collections
@var{proc} is a procedure taking as many arguments as there are
@var{collections} (at least one).  The @var{collections} are iterated
over in their natural order and @var{proc} is applied to the elements
yielded by each iteration in turn.  The order in which the arguments are
supplied corresponds to te order in which the @var{collections} appear.
@code{do-elts} is used when only side-effects of @var{proc} are of
interest and its return value is unspecified.  @code{map-elts} returns a
collection (actually a vector) of the results of the applications of
@var{proc}.

Example:
@lisp
(map-elts + (list 1 2 3) (vector 1 2 3))
   @result{} #(2 4 6)
@end lisp
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure map-keys proc . collections
@deffnx Procedure do-keys proc . collections
These are analogous to @code{map-elts} and @code{do-elts}, but each
iteration is over the @var{collections}' @emph{keys} rather than their
elements.

Example:
@lisp
(map-keys + (list 1 2 3) (vector 1 2 3))
   @result{} #(0 2 4)
@end lisp
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure for-each-key collection proc
@deffnx Procedure for-each-elt collection proc
These are like @code{do-keys} and @code{do-elts} but only for a single
collection; they are potentially more efficient.
@end deffn

@defun reduce proc seed . collections

@ftindex common-list-functions

Examples:
@lisp

   @result{} 6
(reduce union '() '((a b c) (b c d) (d a)))
   @result{} (c b d a).
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun any? pred . collections
A generalization of the list-based @code{some} (@pxref{Lists as

   @result{} #t
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun every? pred . collections
A generalization of the list-based @code{every} (@pxref{Lists as

@node Hash Tables, Hashing, Dynamic Data Type, Data Structures
@subsection Hash Tables

@code{(require 'hash-table)}
@ftindex hash-table

@defun predicate->hash pred
Returns a hash function (like @code{hashq}, @code{hashv}, or
@code{hash}) corresponding to the equality predicate @var{pred}.
@var{pred} should be @code{eq?}, @code{eqv?}, @code{equal?}, @code{=},
@code{char=?}, @code{char-ci=?}, @code{string=?}, or
@code{string-ci=?}.
@end defun

A hash table is a vector of association lists.

@defun make-hash-table k
Returns a vector of @var{k} empty (association) lists.
@end defun

Hash table functions provide utilities for an associative database.
These functions take an equality predicate, @var{pred}, as an argument.
@var{pred} should be @code{eq?}, @code{eqv?}, @code{equal?}, @code{=},
@code{char=?}, @code{char-ci=?}, @code{string=?}, or
@code{string-ci=?}.

@defun predicate->hash-asso pred
Returns a hash association function of 2 arguments, @var{key} and
@var{hashtab}, corresponding to @var{pred}.  The returned function
returns a key-value pair whose key is @var{pred}-equal to its first
argument or @code{#f} if no key in @var{hashtab} is @var{pred}-equal to
the first argument.
@end defun

@defun hash-inquirer pred
Returns a procedure of 3 arguments, @code{hashtab} and @code{key}, which
returns the value associated with @code{key} in @code{hashtab} or
@code{#f} if key does not appear in @code{hashtab}.
@end defun

@defun hash-associator pred
Returns a procedure of 3 arguments, @var{hashtab}, @var{key}, and
@var{value}, which modifies @var{hashtab} so that @var{key} and
@var{value} associated.  Any previous value associated with @var{key}
will be lost.
@end defun

@defun hash-remover pred
Returns a procedure of 2 arguments, @var{hashtab} and @var{key}, which
modifies @var{hashtab} so that the association whose key is @var{key} is
removed.
@end defun

@defun hash-map proc hash-table
Returns a new hash table formed by mapping @var{proc} over the
keys and values of @var{hash-table}.  @var{proc} must be a function of 2
arguments which returns the new value part.
@end defun

@defun hash-for-each proc hash-table
Applies @var{proc} to each pair of keys and values of @var{hash-table}.
@var{proc} must be a function of 2 arguments.  The returned value is
unspecified.
@end defun





@node Hashing, Object, Hash Tables, Data Structures
@subsection Hashing

@code{(require 'hash)}
@ftindex hash

These hashing functions are for use in quickly classifying objects.
Hash tables use these functions.

@defun hashq obj k
@defunx hashv obj k
@defunx hash obj k
Returns an exact non-negative integer less than @var{k}.  For each
non-negative integer less than @var{k} there are arguments @var{obj} for
which the hashing functions applied to @var{obj} and @var{k} returns
that integer.

For @code{hashq}, @code{(eq? obj1 obj2)} implies @code{(= (hashq obj1 k)
(hashq obj2))}.

For @code{hashv}, @code{(eqv? obj1 obj2)} implies @code{(= (hashv obj1 k)
(hashv obj2))}.

For @code{hash}, @code{(equal? obj1 obj2)} implies @code{(= (hash obj1 k)
(hash obj2))}.

@code{hash}, @code{hashv}, and @code{hashq} return in time bounded by a
constant.  Notice that items having the same @code{hash} implies the
items have the same @code{hashv} implies the items have the same
@code{hashq}.
@end defun


@code{(require 'sierpinski)}
@ftindex sierpinski

@defun make-sierpinski-indexer max-coordinate
Returns a procedure (eg hash-function) of 2 numeric arguments which
preserves @emph{nearness} in its mapping from NxN to N.

@var{max-coordinate} is the maximum coordinate (a positive integer) of a
population of points.  The returned procedures is a function that takes
the x and y coordinates of a point, (non-negative integers) and returns
an integer corresponding to the relative position of that point along a
Sierpinski curve.  (You can think of this as computing a (pseudo-)
inverse of the Sierpinski spacefilling curve.)

Example use: Make an indexer (hash-function) for integer points lying in
square of integer grid points [0,99]x[0,99]:
@example
(define space-key (make-sierpinski-indexer 100))
@end example
Now let's compute the index of some points:
@example
(space-key 24 78)               @result{} 9206
(space-key 23 80)               @result{} 9172
@end example

Note that locations (24, 78) and (23, 80) are near in index and
therefore, because the Sierpinski spacefilling curve is continuous, we
know they must also be near in the plane.  Nearness in the plane does
not, however, necessarily correspond to nearness in index, although it
@emph{tends} to be so.

Example applications:
@itemize @bullet

@item
Sort points by Sierpinski index to get heuristic solution to
@emph{travelling salesman problem}.  For details of performance,
see L. Platzman and J. Bartholdi, "Spacefilling curves and the
Euclidean travelling salesman problem", JACM 36(4):719--737
(October 1989) and references therein.

@item
Use Sierpinski index as key by which to store 2-dimensional data
in a 1-dimensional data structure (such as a table).  Then
locations that are near each other in 2-d space will tend to
be near each other in 1-d data structure; and locations that
are near in 1-d data structure will be near in 2-d space.  This
can significantly speed retrieval from secondary storage because
contiguous regions in the plane will tend to correspond to
contiguous regions in secondary storage.  (This is a standard
technique for managing CAD/CAM or geographic data.)

@end itemize
@end defun



@code{(require 'soundex)}
@ftindex soundex

@defun soundex name
Computes the @emph{soundex} hash of @var{name}.  Returns a string of an
initial letter and up to three digits between 0 and 6.  Soundex
supposedly has the property that names that sound similar in normal
English pronunciation tend to map to the same key.

Soundex was a classic algorithm used for manual filing of personal
records before the advent of computers.  It performs adequately for
English names but has trouble with other languages.

See Knuth, Vol. 3 @cite{Sorting and searching}, pp 391--2

To manage unusual inputs, @code{soundex} omits all non-alphabetic
characters.  Consequently, in this implementation:

@example
(soundex <string of blanks>)    @result{} ""
(soundex "")                    @result{} ""
@end example

Examples from Knuth:

@example
(map soundex '("Euler" "Gauss" "Hilbert" "Knuth"
                       "Lloyd" "Lukasiewicz"))
        @result{} ("E460" "G200" "H416" "K530" "L300" "L222")

(map soundex '("Ellery" "Ghosh" "Heilbronn" "Kant"
                        "Ladd" "Lissajous"))
        @result{} ("E460" "G200" "H416" "K530" "L300" "L222")
@end example

Some cases in which the algorithm fails (Knuth):

@example
(map soundex '("Rogers" "Rodgers"))     @result{} ("R262" "R326")

(map soundex '("Sinclair" "St. Clair")) @result{} ("S524" "S324")

(map soundex '("Tchebysheff" "Chebyshev")) @result{} ("T212" "C121")

@node Records, Structures, Queues, Data Structures
@subsection Records

@code{(require 'record)}
@ftindex record

The Record package provides a facility for user to define their own
record data types.

@defun make-record-type type-name field-names
Returns a @dfn{record-type descriptor}, a value representing a new data
type disjoint from all others.  The @var{type-name} argument must be a
string, but is only used for debugging purposes (such as the printed
representation of a record of the new type).  The @var{field-names}
argument is a list of symbols naming the @dfn{fields} of a record of the
new type.  It is an error if the list contains any duplicates.  It is
unspecified how record-type descriptors are represented.
@end defun

@c @defun make-record-sub-type type-name field-names rtd
@c Returns a @dfn{record-type descriptor}, a value representing a new data
@c type, disjoint from all others.  The @var{type-name} argument must be a
@c string.  The @var{field-names} argument is a list of symbols naming the
@c additional @dfn{fields} to be appended to @var{field-names} of
@c @var{rtd}.  It is an error if the combinded list contains any
@c duplicates.
@c
@c Record-modifiers and record-accessors for @var{rtd} work for the new
@c record-sub-type as well.  But record-modifiers and record-accessors for
@c the new record-sub-type will not neccessarily work for @var{rtd}.
@c @end defun

@defun record-constructor rtd [field-names]
Returns a procedure for constructing new members of the type represented
by @var{rtd}.  The returned procedure accepts exactly as many arguments
as there are symbols in the given list, @var{field-names}; these are
used, in order, as the initial values of those fields in a new record,
which is returned by the constructor procedure.  The values of any
fields not named in that list are unspecified.  The @var{field-names}
argument defaults to the list of field names in the call to
@code{make-record-type} that created the type represented by @var{rtd};
if the @var{field-names} argument is provided, it is an error if it
contains any duplicates or any symbols not in the default list.
@end defun

@defun record-predicate rtd
Returns a procedure for testing membership in the type represented by
@var{rtd}.  The returned procedure accepts exactly one argument and
returns a true value if the argument is a member of the indicated record
type; it returns a false value otherwise.
@end defun

@c @defun record-sub-predicate rtd
@c Returns a procedure for testing membership in the type represented by
@c @var{rtd} or its parents.  The returned procedure accepts exactly one
@c argument and returns a true value if the argument is a member of the
@c indicated record type or its parents; it returns a false value
@c otherwise.
@c @end defun

@defun record-accessor rtd field-name
Returns a procedure for reading the value of a particular field of a
member of the type represented by @var{rtd}.  The returned procedure
accepts exactly one argument which must be a record of the appropriate
type; it returns the current value of the field named by the symbol
@var{field-name} in that record.  The symbol @var{field-name} must be a
member of the list of field-names in the call to @code{make-record-type}
that created the type represented by @var{rtd}.
@end defun


@defun record-modifier rtd field-name
Returns a procedure for writing the value of a particular field of a
member of the type represented by @var{rtd}.  The returned procedure
accepts exactly two arguments: first, a record of the appropriate type,
and second, an arbitrary Scheme value; it modifies the field named by
the symbol @var{field-name} in that record to contain the given value.
The returned value of the modifier procedure is unspecified.  The symbol
@var{field-name} must be a member of the list of field-names in the call
to @code{make-record-type} that created the type represented by
@var{rtd}.
@end defun

In May of 1996, as a product of discussion on the @code{rrrs-authors}
mailing list, I rewrote @file{record.scm} to portably implement type
disjointness for record data types.

As long as an implementation's procedures are opaque and the
@code{record} code is loaded before other programs, this will give
disjoint record types which are unforgeable and incorruptible by R4RS
procedures.

As a consequence, the procedures @code{record?},
@code{record-type-descriptor}, @code{record-type-name}.and
@code{record-type-field-names} are no longer supported.

@ignore
@defun record? obj
Returns a true value if @var{obj} is a record of any type and a false
value otherwise.  Note that @code{record?} may be true of any Scheme
value; of course, if it returns true for some particular value, then
@code{record-type-descriptor} is applicable to that value and returns an
appropriate descriptor.
@end defun

@defun record-type-descriptor record
Returns a record-type descriptor representing the type of the given
record.  That is, for example, if the returned descriptor were passed to
@code{record-predicate}, the resulting predicate would return a true
value when passed the given record.  Note that it is not necessarily the
case that the returned descriptor is the one that was passed to
@code{record-constructor} in the call that created the constructor
procedure that created the given record.
@end defun

@defun record-type-name rtd
Returns the type-name associated with the type represented by rtd.  The
returned value is @code{eqv?} to the @var{type-name} argument given in
the call to @code{make-record-type} that created the type represented by
@var{rtd}.
@end defun

@defun record-type-field-names rtd
Returns a list of the symbols naming the fields in members of the type
represented by @var{rtd}.  The returned value is @code{equal?} to the

created the type represented by @var{rtd}.

@node List construction, Lists as sets, Common List Functions, Common List Functions
@subsubsection List construction

@defun make-list k . init
@code{make-list} creates and returns a list of @var{k} elements.  If
@var{init} is included, all elements in the list are initialized to
@var{init}.

Example:
@lisp
(make-list 3)
   @result{} (#<unspecified> #<unspecified> #<unspecified>)
(make-list 5 'foo)
   @result{} (foo foo foo foo foo)
@end lisp
@end defun


@defun list* x . y
Works like @code{list} except that the cdr of the last pair is the last
argument unless there is only one argument, when the result is just that
argument.  Sometimes called @code{cons*}.  E.g.:@refill
@lisp
(list* 1)
   @result{} 1
(list* 1 2 3)
   @result{} (1 2 . 3)
(list* 1 2 '(3 4))
   @result{} (1 2 3 4)
(list* @var{args} '())
   @equiv{} (list @var{args})
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun copy-list lst
@code{copy-list} makes a copy of @var{lst} using new pairs and returns
it. Only the top level of the list is copied, i.e., pairs forming
elements of the copied list remain @code{eq?} to the corresponding
elements of the original; the copy is, however, not @code{eq?} to the
original, but is @code{equal?} to it.

Example:
@lisp
(copy-list '(foo foo foo))
   @result{} (foo foo foo)
(define q '(foo bar baz bang))
(define p q)
(eq? p q)
   @result{} #t
(define r (copy-list q))
(eq? q r)
   @result{} #f
(equal? q r)
   @result{} #t
(define bar '(bar))
(eq? bar (car (copy-list (list bar 'foo))))
@result{} #t
   @end lisp
@end defun






@node Lists as sets, Lists as sequences, List construction, Common List Functions
@subsubsection Lists as sets

@code{eqv?} is used to test for membership by procedures which treat
lists as sets.

@defun adjoin e l
@code{adjoin} returns the adjoint of the element @var{e} and the list
@var{l}.  That is, if @var{e} is in @var{l}, @code{adjoin} returns
@var{l}, otherwise, it returns @code{(cons @var{e} @var{l})}.

Example:
@lisp
(adjoin 'baz '(bar baz bang))
   @result{} (bar baz bang)
(adjoin 'foo '(bar baz bang))
   @result{} (foo bar baz bang)
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun union l1 l2
@code{union} returns the combination of @var{l1} and @var{l2}.
Duplicates between @var{l1} and @var{l2} are culled.  Duplicates within
@var{l1} or within @var{l2} may or may not be removed.

Example:
@lisp
(union '(1 2 3 4) '(5 6 7 8))
   @result{} (4 3 2 1 5 6 7 8)
(union '(1 2 3 4) '(3 4 5 6))
   @result{} (2 1 3 4 5 6)
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun intersection l1 l2
@code{intersection} returns all elements that are in both @var{l1} and
@var{l2}.

Example:
@lisp
(intersection '(1 2 3 4) '(3 4 5 6))
   @result{} (4 3)
(intersection '(1 2 3 4) '(5 6 7 8))
   @result{} ()
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun set-difference l1 l2
@code{set-difference} returns all elements that are in @var{l1} but not
in @var{l2}.

Example:
@lisp
(set-difference '(1 2 3 4) '(3 4 5 6))
   @result{} (2 1)
(set-difference '(1 2 3 4) '(1 2 3 4 5 6))
   @result{} ()
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun member-if pred lst
@code{member-if} returns @var{lst} if @code{(@var{pred} @var{element})}
is @code{#t} for any @var{element} in @var{lst}.  Returns @code{#f} if
@var{pred} does not apply to any @var{element} in @var{lst}.

Example:
@lisp
(member-if vector? '(1 2 3 4))
   @result{} #f
(member-if number? '(1 2 3 4))
   @result{} (1 2 3 4)
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun some pred lst . more-lsts
@var{pred} is a boolean function of as many arguments as there are list
arguments to @code{some} i.e., @var{lst} plus any optional arguments.
@var{pred} is applied to successive elements of the list arguments in
order.  @code{some} returns @code{#t} as soon as one of these
applications returns @code{#t}, and is @code{#f} if none returns
@code{#t}.  All the lists should have the same length.


Example:
@lisp
(some odd? '(1 2 3 4))
   @result{} #t

(some odd? '(2 4 6 8))
   @result{} #f

(some > '(2 3) '(1 4))
   @result{} #f
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun every pred lst . more-lsts
@code{every} is analogous to @code{some} except it returns @code{#t} if
every application of @var{pred} is @code{#t} and @code{#f}
otherwise.

Example:
@lisp
(every even? '(1 2 3 4))
   @result{} #f

(every even? '(2 4 6 8))
   @result{} #t

(every > '(2 3) '(1 4))
   @result{} #f
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun notany pred . lst
@code{notany} is analogous to @code{some} but returns @code{#t} if no
application of @var{pred} returns @code{#t} or @code{#f} as soon as any
one does.
@end defun

@defun notevery pred . lst
@code{notevery} is analogous to @code{some} but returns @code{#t} as soon
as an application of @var{pred} returns @code{#f}, and @code{#f}
otherwise.

Example:
@lisp
(notevery even? '(1 2 3 4))
   @result{} #t

(notevery even? '(2 4 6 8))
   @result{} #f
@end lisp
@end defun


@defun list-of?? predicate
Returns a predicate which returns true if its argument is a list every
element of which satisfies @var{predicate}.

@defunx list-of?? predicate low-bound high-bound
@var{low-bound} and @var{high-bound} are non-negative integers.
@code{list-of??} returns a predicate which returns true if its argument
is a list of length between @var{low-bound} and @var{high-bound}
(inclusive); every element of which satisfies @var{predicate}.

@defunx list-of?? predicate bound
@var{bound} is an integer.  If @var{bound} is negative, @code{list-of??}
returns a predicate which returns true if its argument is a list of
length greater than @code{(- @var{bound})}; every element of which
satisfies @var{predicate}.  Otherwise, @code{list-of??}  returns a
predicate which returns true if its argument is a list of length less
than or equal to @var{bound}; every element of which satisfies
@var{predicate}.
@end defun


@defun find-if pred lst
@code{find-if} searches for the first @var{element} in @var{lst} such
that @code{(@var{pred} @var{element})} returns @code{#t}.  If it finds
any such @var{element} in @var{lst}, @var{element} is returned.
Otherwise, @code{#f} is returned.

Example:
@lisp
(find-if number? '(foo 1 bar 2))
   @result{} 1

(find-if number? '(foo bar baz bang))
   @result{} #f

(find-if symbol? '(1 2 foo bar))
   @result{} foo
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun remove elt lst
@code{remove} removes all occurrences of @var{elt} from @var{lst} using
@code{eqv?} to test for equality and returns everything that's left.
N.B.: other implementations (Chez, Scheme->C and T, at least) use
@code{equal?} as the equality test.

Example:
@lisp
(remove 1 '(1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5))
   @result{} (5 4 3 2)

(remove 'foo '(bar baz bang))
   @result{} (bang baz bar)
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun remove-if pred lst
@code{remove-if} removes all @var{element}s from @var{lst} where
@code{(@var{pred} @var{element})} is @code{#t} and returns everything
that's left.

Example:
@lisp
(remove-if number? '(1 2 3 4))
   @result{} ()

(remove-if even? '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8))
   @result{} (7 5 3 1)
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun remove-if-not pred lst
@code{remove-if-not} removes all @var{element}s from @var{lst} for which
@code{(@var{pred} @var{element})} is @code{#f} and returns everything that's
left.

Example:
@lisp
(remove-if-not number? '(foo bar baz))
   @result{} ()
(remove-if-not odd? '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8))
   @result{} (7 5 3 1)
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun has-duplicates? lst
returns @code{#t} if 2 members of @var{lst} are @code{equal?}, @code{#f}
otherwise.

Example:
@lisp
(has-duplicates? '(1 2 3 4))
   @result{} #f

(has-duplicates? '(2 4 3 4))
   @result{} #t
@end lisp
@end defun

The procedure @code{remove-duplicates} uses @code{member} (rather than
@code{memv}).

@defun remove-duplicates lst
returns a copy of @var{lst} with its duplicate members removed.
Elements are considered duplicate if they are @code{equal?}.

Example:
@lisp
(remove-duplicates '(1 2 3 4))
   @result{} (4 3 2 1)

(remove-duplicates '(2 4 3 4))
   @result{} (3 4 2)
@end lisp
@end defun


@node Lists as sequences, Destructive list operations, Lists as sets, Common List Functions
@subsubsection Lists as sequences

@defun position obj lst
@code{position} returns the 0-based position of @var{obj} in @var{lst},
or @code{#f} if @var{obj} does not occur in @var{lst}.

Example:
@lisp
(position 'foo '(foo bar baz bang))
   @result{} 0
(position 'baz '(foo bar baz bang))
   @result{} 2
(position 'oops '(foo bar baz bang))
   @result{} #f
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun reduce p lst
@code{reduce} combines all the elements of a sequence using a binary
operation (the combination is left-associative).  For example, using
@code{+}, one can add up all the elements.  @code{reduce} allows you to
apply a function which accepts only two arguments to more than 2
objects.  Functional programmers usually refer to this as @dfn{foldl}.
@code{collect:reduce} (@pxref{Collections}) provides a version of
@code{collect} generalized to collections.

Example:
@lisp
(reduce + '(1 2 3 4))
   @result{} 10
(define (bad-sum . l) (reduce + l))
(bad-sum 1 2 3 4)
   @equiv{} (reduce + (1 2 3 4))
   @equiv{} (+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) 4)
@result{} 10
(bad-sum)
   @equiv{} (reduce + ())
   @result{} ()
(reduce string-append '("hello" "cruel" "world"))
   @equiv{} (string-append (string-append "hello" "cruel") "world")
   @result{} "hellocruelworld"
(reduce anything '())
   @result{} ()
(reduce anything '(x))
   @result{} x
@end lisp

What follows is a rather non-standard implementation of @code{reverse}
in terms of @code{reduce} and a combinator elsewhere called
@dfn{C}.

@lisp
;;; Contributed by Jussi Piitulainen (jpiitula@@ling.helsinki.fi)

(define commute
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x y)
      (f y x))))

(define reverse
  (lambda (args)
    (reduce-init (commute cons) '() args)))
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun reduce-init p init lst
@code{reduce-init} is the same as reduce, except that it implicitly
inserts @var{init} at the start of the list.  @code{reduce-init} is
preferred if you want to handle the null list, the one-element, and
lists with two or more elements consistently.  It is common to use the
operator's idempotent as the initializer.  Functional programmers
usually call this @dfn{foldl}.

Example:
@lisp
(define (sum . l) (reduce-init + 0 l))
(sum 1 2 3 4)
   @equiv{} (reduce-init + 0 (1 2 3 4))
   @equiv{} (+ (+ (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 3) 4)
   @result{} 10
(sum)
   @equiv{} (reduce-init + 0 '())
   @result{} 0

(reduce-init string-append "@@" '("hello" "cruel" "world"))
@equiv{}
(string-append (string-append (string-append "@@" "hello")
                               "cruel")
               "world")
@result{} "@@hellocruelworld"
@end lisp

Given a differentiation of 2 arguments, @code{diff}, the following will
differentiate by any number of variables.
@lisp
(define (diff* exp . vars)
  (reduce-init diff exp vars))
@end lisp

Example:
@lisp
;;; Real-world example:  Insertion sort using reduce-init.

(define (insert l item)
  (if (null? l)
      (list item)
      (if (< (car l) item)
          (cons (car l) (insert (cdr l) item))
          (cons item l))))
(define (insertion-sort l) (reduce-init insert '() l))

(insertion-sort '(3 1 4 1 5)
   @equiv{} (reduce-init insert () (3 1 4 1 5))
   @equiv{} (insert (insert (insert (insert (insert () 3) 1) 4) 1) 5)
   @equiv{} (insert (insert (insert (insert (3)) 1) 4) 1) 5)
   @equiv{} (insert (insert (insert (1 3) 4) 1) 5)
   @equiv{} (insert (insert (1 3 4) 1) 5)
   @equiv{} (insert (1 1 3 4) 5)
   @result{} (1 1 3 4 5)
   @end lisp
@end defun

@defun last lst n
@code{last} returns the last @var{n} elements of @var{lst}.  @var{n}
must be a non-negative integer.

Example:
@lisp
(last '(foo bar baz bang) 2)
   @result{} (baz bang)
(last '(1 2 3) 0)
   @result{} 0
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun butlast lst n
@code{butlast} returns all but the last @var{n} elements of
@var{lst}.

Example:
@lisp
(butlast '(a b c d) 3)
   @result{} (a)
(butlast '(a b c d) 4)
   @result{} ()
@end lisp
@end defun

@noindent
@code{last} and @code{butlast} split a list into two parts when given
identical arugments.
@example
(last '(a b c d e) 2)
   @result{} (d e)
(butlast '(a b c d e) 2)
   @result{} (a b c)
@end example

@defun nthcdr n lst
@code{nthcdr} takes @var{n} @code{cdr}s of @var{lst} and returns the
result.  Thus @code{(nthcdr 3 @var{lst})} @equiv{} @code{(cdddr
@var{lst})}

Example:
@lisp
(nthcdr 2 '(a b c d))
   @result{} (c d)
(nthcdr 0 '(a b c d))
   @result{} (a b c d)
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun butnthcdr n lst
@code{butnthcdr} returns all but the nthcdr @var{n} elements of
@var{lst}.

Example:
@lisp
(butnthcdr 3 '(a b c d))
   @result{} (a b c)
(butnthcdr 4 '(a b c d))
   @result{} (a b c d)
@end lisp
@end defun

@noindent
@code{nthcdr} and @code{butnthcdr} split a list into two parts when
given identical arugments.
@example
(nthcdr 2 '(a b c d e))
   @result{} (c d e)
(butnthcdr 2 '(a b c d e))
   @result{} (a b)
@end example



@node Destructive list operations, Non-List functions, Lists as sequences, Common List Functions
@subsubsection Destructive list operations

These procedures may mutate the list they operate on, but any such
mutation is undefined.

@deffn Procedure nconc args
@code{nconc} destructively concatenates its arguments.  (Compare this
with @code{append}, which copies arguments rather than destroying them.)
Sometimes called @code{append!} (@pxref{Rev2 Procedures}).

Example:  You want to find the subsets of a set.  Here's the obvious way:

@lisp
(define (subsets set)
  (if (null? set)
      '(())
      (append (mapcar (lambda (sub) (cons (car set) sub))
                      (subsets (cdr set)))
              (subsets (cdr set)))))
@end lisp
But that does way more consing than you need.  Instead, you could
replace the @code{append} with @code{nconc}, since you don't have any
need for all the intermediate results.

Example:
@lisp
(define x '(a b c))
(define y '(d e f))
(nconc x y)
   @result{} (a b c d e f)
x
   @result{} (a b c d e f)
@end lisp

@code{nconc} is the same as @code{append!} in @file{sc2.scm}.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure nreverse lst
@code{nreverse} reverses the order of elements in @var{lst} by mutating
@code{cdr}s of the list.  Sometimes called @code{reverse!}.

Example:
@lisp
(define foo '(a b c))
(nreverse foo)
   @result{} (c b a)
foo
   @result{} (a)
@end lisp

Some people have been confused about how to use @code{nreverse},
thinking that it doesn't return a value.  It needs to be pointed out
that@refill
@lisp
(set! lst (nreverse lst))
@end lisp
@noindent
is the proper usage, not
@lisp
(nreverse lst)
@end lisp
The example should suffice to show why this is the case.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure delete elt lst
@deffnx Procedure delete-if pred lst
@deffnx Procedure delete-if-not pred lst
Destructive versions of @code{remove} @code{remove-if}, and
@code{remove-if-not}.

Example:
@lisp
(define lst '(foo bar baz bang))
(delete 'foo lst)
   @result{} (bar baz bang)
lst
   @result{} (foo bar baz bang)

(define lst '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))
(delete-if odd? lst)
   @result{} (2 4 6 8)
lst
   @result{} (1 2 4 6 8)
@end lisp

Some people have been confused about how to use @code{delete},
@code{delete-if}, and @code{delete-if}, thinking that they dont' return
a value.  It needs to be pointed out that@refill
@lisp
(set! lst (delete el lst))
@end lisp
@noindent
is the proper usage, not
@lisp
(delete el lst)
@end lisp
The examples should suffice to show why this is the case.

@node Non-List functions,  , Destructive list operations, Common List Functions
@subsubsection Non-List functions

@defun and? . args
@code{and?} checks to see if all its arguments are true.  If they are,
@code{and?} returns @code{#t}, otherwise, @code{#f}.  (In contrast to
@code{and}, this is a function, so all arguments are always evaluated
and in an unspecified order.)@refill

Example:
@lisp
(and? 1 2 3)
   @result{} #t
(and #f 1 2)
   @result{} #f
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun or? . args
@code{or?} checks to see if any of its arguments are true.  If any is
true, @code{or?} returns @code{#t}, and @code{#f} otherwise.  (To
@code{or} as @code{and?} is to @code{and}.)@refill

(or? 1 2 #f)
   @result{} #t
(or? #f #f #f)

@node Tree Operations, Type Coercion, Common List Functions, Procedures
@subsection Tree operations

@code{(require 'tree)}
@ftindex tree

These are operations that treat lists a representations of trees.

@defun subst new old tree
@defunx substq new old tree
@defunx substv new old tree
@code{subst} makes a copy of @var{tree}, substituting @var{new} for
every subtree or leaf of @var{tree} which is @code{equal?} to @var{old}
and returns a modified tree.  The original @var{tree} is unchanged, but
may share parts with the result.

@code{substq} and @code{substv} are similar, but test against @var{old}
using @code{eq?} and @code{eqv?} respectively.

Examples:
@lisp
(substq 'tempest 'hurricane '(shakespeare wrote (the hurricane)))
   @result{} (shakespeare wrote (the tempest))
(substq 'foo '() '(shakespeare wrote (twelfth night)))
   @result{} (shakespeare wrote (twelfth night . foo) . foo)

   @result{} ((old . spice) ((old . shoes) a . cons) (a . cons))
@end lisp

@defun copy-tree tree
Makes a copy of the nested list structure @var{tree} using new pairs and
returns it.  All levels are copied, so that none of the pairs in the
tree are @code{eq?} to the original ones -- only the leaves are.

Example:
@lisp
(define bar '(bar))

   @result{} ((bar) foo)
(eq? bar (car (copy-tree (list bar 'foo))))
   @result{} #f

@code{(require 'chapter-order)}
@ftindex chapter-order

The @samp{chap:} functions deal with strings which are ordered like
chapter numbers (or letters) in a book.  Each section of the string
consists of consecutive numeric or consecutive aphabetic characters of
like case.

@defun chap:string<? string1 string2
Returns #t if the first non-matching run of alphabetic upper-case or the
first non-matching run of alphabetic lower-case or the first
non-matching run of numeric characters of @var{string1} is
@code{string<?} than the corresponding non-matching run of characters of

@code{(string-append @var{string} "0")} is returnd.  The argument to
chap:next-string will always be @code{chap:string<?} than the result.

@code{(require 'sort)}
@ftindex sort

Many Scheme systems provide some kind of sorting functions.  They do
not, however, always provide the @emph{same} sorting functions, and
those that I have had the opportunity to test provided inefficient ones
(a common blunder is to use quicksort which does not perform well).

Because @code{sort} and @code{sort!} are not in the standard, there is
very little agreement about what these functions look like.  For
example, Dybvig says that Chez Scheme provides
@lisp
(merge predicate list1 list2)
(merge! predicate list1 list2)
(sort predicate list)
(sort! predicate list)
@end lisp
@noindent
while MIT Scheme 7.1, following Common LISP, offers unstable
@lisp
(sort list predicate)
@end lisp
@noindent
TI PC Scheme offers
@lisp
(sort! list/vector predicate?)
@end lisp
@noindent
and Elk offers
@lisp
(sort list/vector predicate?)
(sort! list/vector predicate?)
@end lisp

Here is a comprehensive catalogue of the variations I have found.

@enumerate
@item
Both @code{sort} and @code{sort!} may be provided.
@item
@code{sort} may be provided without @code{sort!}.
@item
@code{sort!} may be provided without @code{sort}.
@item
Neither may be provided.
@item
The sequence argument may be either a list or a vector.
@item
The sequence argument may only be a list.
@item
The sequence argument may only be a vector.
@item
The comparison function may be expected to behave like @code{<}.
@item
The comparison function may be expected to behave like @code{<=}.
@item
The interface may be @code{(sort predicate? sequence)}.
@item
The interface may be @code{(sort sequence predicate?)}.
@item
The interface may be @code{(sort sequence &optional (predicate? <))}.
@item
The sort may be stable.
@item
The sort may be unstable.
@end enumerate

All of this variation really does not help anybody.  A nice simple merge
sort is both stable and fast (quite a lot faster than @emph{quick} sort).

I am providing this source code with no restrictions at all on its use
(but please retain D.H.D.Warren's credit for the original idea).  You
may have to rename some of these functions in order to use them in a
system which already provides incompatible or inferior sorts.  For each
of the functions, only the top-level define needs to be edited to do
that.

I could have given these functions names which would not clash with any
Scheme that I know of, but I would like to encourage implementors to
converge on a single interface, and this may serve as a hint.  The
argument order for all functions has been chosen to be as close to
Common LISP as made sense, in order to avoid NIH-itis.

Each of the five functions has a required @emph{last} parameter which is
a comparison function.  A comparison function @code{f} is a function of
2 arguments which acts like @code{<}.  For example,@refill

@lisp
(not (f x x))
(and (f x y) (f y z)) @equiv{} (f x z)
@end lisp

The standard functions @code{<}, @code{>}, @code{char<?}, @code{char>?},
@code{char-ci<?}, @code{char-ci>?}, @code{string<?}, @code{string>?},
@code{string-ci<?}, and @code{string-ci>?} are suitable for use as
comparison functions.  Think of @code{(less? x y)} as saying when
@code{x} must @emph{not} precede @code{y}.

@defun sorted? sequence less?
Returns @code{#t} when the sequence argument is in non-decreasing order
according to @var{less?} (that is, there is no adjacent pair @code{@dots{} x
y @dots{}} for which @code{(less? y x)}).

Returns @code{#f} when the sequence contains at least one out-of-order
pair.  It is an error if the sequence is neither a list nor a vector.
@end defun

@defun merge list1 list2 less?
This merges two lists, producing a completely new list as result.  I
gave serious consideration to producing a Common-LISP-compatible
version.  However, Common LISP's @code{sort} is our @code{sort!} (well,
in fact Common LISP's @code{stable-sort} is our @code{sort!}, merge sort
is @emph{fast} as well as stable!) so adapting CL code to Scheme takes a
bit of work anyway.  I did, however, appeal to CL to determine the
@emph{order} of the arguments.
@end defun

@deffn Procedure merge! list1 list2 less?
Merges two lists, re-using the pairs of @var{list1} and @var{list2} to
build the result.  If the code is compiled, and @var{less?} constructs
no new pairs, no pairs at all will be allocated.  The first pair of the
result will be either the first pair of @var{list1} or the first pair of
@var{list2}, but you can't predict which.

The code of @code{merge} and @code{merge!} could have been quite a bit
simpler, but they have been coded to reduce the amount of work done per
iteration.  (For example, we only have one @code{null?} test per
iteration.)@refill
@end deffn

@defun sort sequence less?
Accepts either a list or a vector, and returns a new sequence which is
sorted.  The new sequence is the same type as the input.  Always
@code{(sorted? (sort sequence less?) less?)}.  The original sequence is
not altered in any way.  The new sequence shares its @emph{elements}
with the old one; no elements are copied.
@end defun

@deffn Procedure sort! sequence less?
Returns its sorted result in the original boxes.  If the original
sequence is a list, no new storage is allocated at all.  If the original
sequence is a vector, the sorted elements are put back in the same
vector.

Some people have been confused about how to use @code{sort!}, thinking
that it doesn't return a value.  It needs to be pointed out that
@lisp
(set! slist (sort! slist <))
@end lisp
@noindent
is the proper usage, not
@lisp
(sort! slist <)
@end lisp
@end deffn

Note that these functions do @emph{not} accept a CL-style @samp{:key}
argument.  A simple device for obtaining the same expressiveness is to
define@refill
@lisp
(define (keyed less? key)
  (lambda (x y) (less? (key x) (key y))))
@end lisp
@noindent
and then, when you would have written
@lisp
(sort a-sequence #'my-less :key #'my-key)
@end lisp
@noindent
in Common LISP, just write
@lisp
(sort! a-sequence (keyed my-less? my-key))
@end lisp
@noindent
in Scheme.

@node Topological Sort, String-Case, Sorting, Procedures
@subsection Topological Sort

@code{(require 'topological-sort)} or @code{(require 'tsort)}
@ftindex topological-sort
@ftindex tsort

@noindent
The algorithm is inspired by Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest (1990)
@cite{Introduction to Algorithms}, chapter 23.

@defun tsort dag pred
@defunx topological-sort dag pred
where
@table @var
@item dag
is a list of sublists.  The car of each sublist is a vertex.  The cdr is
the adjacency list of that vertex, i.e. a list of all vertices to which
there exists an edge from the car vertex.
@item pred
is one of @code{eq?}, @code{eqv?}, @code{equal?}, @code{=},
@code{char=?}, @code{char-ci=?}, @code{string=?}, or @code{string-ci=?}.
@end table

Sort the directed acyclic graph @var{dag} so that for every edge from
vertex @var{u} to @var{v}, @var{u} will come before @var{v} in the
resulting list of vertices.

Time complexity: O (|V| + |E|)

Example (from Cormen):
@quotation
Prof. Bumstead topologically sorts his clothing when getting
dressed.  The first argument to `tsort' describes which
garments he needs to put on before others.  (For example,
Prof Bumstead needs to put on his shirt before he puts on his
tie or his belt.)  `tsort' gives the correct order of dressing:
@end quotation

@example
(require 'tsort)
@ftindex tsort
(tsort '((shirt tie belt)
         (tie jacket)
         (belt jacket)

@end deffn

@defun string-upcase! str
@defunx string-downcase! str

The destructive versions of the functions above.
@end defun

@defun string-ci->symbol str
Converts string @var{str} to a symbol having the same case as if the
symbol had been @code{read}.
@end defun

@defun symbol-append obj1 @dots{}
Converts @var{obj1} @dots{} to strings, appends them, and converts to a
symbol which is returned.  Strings and numbers are converted to read's
symbol case; the case of symbol characters is not changed.  #f is
converted to the empty string (symbol).
@end defun



@node String Ports, String Search, String-Case, Procedures
@subsection String Ports

@code{(require 'string-port)}
@ftindex string-port

@deffn Procedure call-with-output-string proc
@var{proc} must be a procedure of one argument.  This procedure calls
@var{proc} with one argument: a (newly created) output port.  When the
function returns, the string composed of the characters written into the
port is returned.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure call-with-input-string string proc
@var{proc} must be a procedure of one argument.  This procedure calls
@var{proc} with one argument: an (newly created) input port from which
@var{string}'s contents may be read.  When @var{proc} returns, the port
is closed and the value yielded by the procedure @var{proc} is
returned.
@end deffn


@node String Search, Line I/O, String Ports, Procedures
@subsection String Search

@code{(require 'string-search)}
@ftindex string-search

@deffn Procedure string-index string char
@deffnx Procedure string-index-ci string char
Returns the index of the first occurence of @var{char} within
@var{string}, or @code{#f} if the @var{string} does not contain a
character @var{char}.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure string-reverse-index string char
@deffnx Procedure string-reverse-index-ci string char
Returns the index of the last occurence of @var{char} within
@var{string}, or @code{#f} if the @var{string} does not contain a
character @var{char}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure substring? pattern string
@deffnx procedure substring-ci? pattern string
Searches @var{string} to see if some substring of @var{string} is equal
to @var{pattern}.  @code{substring?} returns the index of the first
character of the first substring of @var{string} that is equal to
@var{pattern}; or @code{#f} if @var{string} does not contain
@var{pattern}.

@example
(substring? "rat" "pirate") @result{}  2
(substring? "rat" "outrage") @result{}  #f
(substring? "" any-string) @result{}  0
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure find-string-from-port? str in-port max-no-chars
Looks for a string @var{str} within the first @var{max-no-chars} chars
of the input port @var{in-port}.

@deffnx Procedure find-string-from-port? str in-port
When called with two arguments, the search span is limited by the end of
the input stream.

@deffnx Procedure find-string-from-port? str in-port char
Searches up to the first occurrence of character @var{char} in
@var{str}.

@deffnx Procedure find-string-from-port? str in-port proc
Searches up to the first occurrence of the procedure @var{proc}
returning non-false when called with a character (from @var{in-port})
argument.

When the @var{str} is found, @code{find-string-from-port?} returns the
number of characters it has read from the port, and the port is set to
read the first char after that (that is, after the @var{str}) The
function returns @code{#f} when the @var{str} isn't found.

@code{find-string-from-port?} reads the port @emph{strictly}
sequentially, and does not perform any buffering.  So
@code{find-string-from-port?} can be used even if the @var{in-port} is
open to a pipe or other communication channel.
@end deffn

@defun string-subst txt old1 new1 @dots{}
Returns a copy of string @var{txt} with all occurrences of string
@var{old1} in @var{txt} replaced with @var{new1}, @var{old2} replaced

@ftindex metric-units

@url{http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/MIXF.html}

@dfn{Metric Interchange Format} is a character string encoding for
numerical values and units which:

@itemize @bullet
@item
is unambiguous in all locales;

@item
uses only [TOG] "Portable Character Set" characters matching "Basic
Latin" characters in Plane 0 of the Universal Character Set [UCS];

@item
is transparent to [UTF-7] and [UTF-8] UCS transformation formats;

@item

is machine readable and writable;

@item
incorporates SI prefixes and units;

@item
incorporates [ISO 6093] numbers; and

@item
incorporates [IEC 60027-2] binary prefixes.
@end itemize

In the expression for the value of a quantity, the unit symbol is placed
after the numerical value.  A dot (PERIOD, @samp{.}) is placed between
the numerical value and the unit symbol.

Within a compound unit, each of the base and derived symbols can
optionally have an attached SI prefix.

Unit symbols formed from other unit symbols by multiplication are
indicated by means of a dot (PERIOD, @samp{.}) placed between them.

Unit symbols formed from other unit symbols by division are indicated by
means of a SOLIDUS (@samp{/}) or negative exponents.  The SOLIDUS must
not be repeated in the same compound unit unless contained within a
parenthesized subexpression.

The grouping formed by a prefix symbol attached to a unit symbol
constitutes a new inseparable symbol (forming a multiple or submultiple
of the unit concerned) which can be raised to a positive or negative
power and which can be combined with other unit symbols to form compound
unit symbols.

The grouping formed by surrounding compound unit symbols with
parentheses (@samp{(} and @samp{)}) constitutes a new inseparable symbol
which can be raised to a positive or negative power and which can be
combined with other unit symbols to form compound unit symbols.

Compound prefix symbols, that is, prefix symbols formed by the
juxtaposition of two or more prefix symbols, are not permitted.

Prefix symbols are not used with the time-related unit symbols min
(minute), h (hour), d (day).  No prefix symbol may be used with dB
(decibel).  Only submultiple prefix symbols may be used with the unit
symbols L (liter), Np (neper), o (degree), oC (degree Celsius), rad
(radian), and sr (steradian).  Submultiple prefix symbols may not be
used with the unit symbols t (metric ton), r (revolution), or Bd (baud).

A unit exponent follows the unit, separated by a CIRCUMFLEX (@samp{^}).
Exponents may be positive or negative.  Fractional exponents must be
parenthesized.

The procedure @dfn{rationalize} is interesting because most programming

Bawden for contributing this algorithm.

@defun rationalize x y
Computes the correct result for exact arguments (provided the
implementation supports exact rational numbers of unlimited precision);
and produces a reasonable answer for inexact arguments when inexact
arithmetic is implemented using floating-point.
@end defun

@code{Rationalize} has limited use in implementations lacking exact
(non-integer) rational numbers.  The following procedures return a list
of the numerator and denominator.

@defun find-ratio x y
@code{find-ratio} returns the list of the @emph{simplest}

@node Dynamic-Wind, Eval, Promises, Standards Support
@subsection Dynamic-Wind

@code{(require 'dynamic-wind)}
@ftindex dynamic-wind

This facility is a generalization of Common LISP @code{unwind-protect},
designed to take into account the fact that continuations produced by
@code{call-with-current-continuation} may be reentered.

@deffn Procedure dynamic-wind thunk1 thunk2 thunk3
The arguments @var{thunk1}, @var{thunk2}, and @var{thunk3} must all be
procedures of no arguments (thunks).

@code{dynamic-wind} calls @var{thunk1}, @var{thunk2}, and then
@var{thunk3}.  The value returned by @var{thunk2} is returned as the
result of @code{dynamic-wind}.  @var{thunk3} is also called just before
control leaves the dynamic context of @var{thunk2} by calling a
continuation created outside that context.  Furthermore, @var{thunk1} is
called before reentering the dynamic context of @var{thunk2} by calling
a continuation created inside that context.  (Control is inside the
context of @var{thunk2} if @var{thunk2} is on the current return stack).

@strong{Warning:} There is no provision for dealing with errors or
interrupts.  If an error or interrupt occurs while using
@code{dynamic-wind}, the dynamic environment will be that in effect at
the time of the error or interrupt.
@end deffn


@node Eval, Values, Dynamic-Wind, Standards Support
@subsection Eval

@code{(require 'eval)}

@defun eval expression environment-specifier

Evaluates @var{expression} in the specified environment and returns its
value.  @var{Expression} must be a valid Scheme expression represented
as data, and @var{environment-specifier} must be a value returned by one
of the three procedures described below.  Implementations may extend
@code{eval} to allow non-expression programs (definitions) as the first
argument and to allow other values as environments, with the restriction
that @code{eval} is not allowed to create new bindings in the
environments associated with @code{null-environment} or
@code{scheme-report-environment}.

@lisp
(eval '(* 7 3) (scheme-report-environment 5))
                                                   @result{}  21

(let ((f (eval '(lambda (f x) (f x x))
               (null-environment))))
  (f + 10))
                                                   @result{}  20
@end lisp
@end defun

@defun scheme-report-environment version
@defunx null-environment version
@defunx null-environment

@var{Version} must be an exact non-negative integer @var{n}
corresponding to a version of one of the Revised^@var{n} Reports on
Scheme.  @code{Scheme-report-environment} returns a specifier for an
environment that contains the set of bindings specified in the
corresponding report that the implementation supports.
@code{Null-environment} returns a specifier for an environment that
contains only the (syntactic) bindings for all the syntactic keywords
defined in the given version of the report.

Not all versions may be available in all implementations at all times.
However, an implementation that conforms to version @var{n} of the
Revised^@var{n} Reports on Scheme must accept version @var{n}.  An error
is signalled if the specified version is not available.

The effect of assigning (through the use of @code{eval}) a variable
bound in a @code{scheme-report-environment} (for example @code{car}) is
unspecified. Thus the environments specified by
@code{scheme-report-environment} may be immutable.

@end defun

@defun interaction-environment

This optional procedure returns a specifier for the environment that
contains implementation-defined bindings, typically a superset of those
listed in the report.  The intent is that this procedure will return the
environment in which the implementation would evaluate expressions
dynamically typed by the user.
@end defun

@noindent
Here are some more @code{eval} examples:

@example
(require 'eval)
@result{} #<unspecified>
(define car 'volvo)
@result{} #<unspecified>
car
@result{} volvo
(eval 'car (interaction-environment))
@result{} volvo
(eval 'car (scheme-report-environment 5))
@result{} #<primitive-procedure car>
(eval '(eval 'car (interaction-environment))
      (scheme-report-environment 5))
@result{} volvo
(eval '(eval '(set! car 'buick) (interaction-environment))
      (scheme-report-environment 5))
@result{} #<unspecified>
car
@result{} buick
(eval 'car (scheme-report-environment 5))
@result{} #<primitive-procedure car>
(eval '(eval 'car (interaction-environment))
      (scheme-report-environment 5))
@result{} buick
@end example

@defun call-with-values thunk proc
@var{thunk} must be a procedure of no arguments, and @var{proc} must be

continuation that, when passed some values, calls @var{proc} with those
values as arguments.

Except for continuations created by the @code{call-with-values}
procedure, all continuations take exactly one value, as now; the effect
of passing no value or more than one value to continuations that were

Here is a read-eval-print-loop which, given an eval, evaluates forms.

@deffn Procedure repl:top-level repl:eval

@end deffn

@deffn Procedure repl:quit
Exits from the invocation of @code{repl:top-level}.
@end deffn

The @code{repl:} procedures establish, as much as is possible to do
portably, a top level environment supporting macros.
@code{repl:top-level} uses @code{dynamic-wind} to catch error conditions
and interrupts.  If your implementation supports this you are all set.

Otherwise, if there is some way your implementation can catch error
conditions and interrupts, then have them call @code{slib:error}.  It
will display its arguments and reenter @code{repl:top-level}.
@code{slib:error} dynamically bound by @code{repl:top-level}.

To have your top level loop always use macros, add any interrupt
catching lines and the following lines to your Scheme init file:

@ftindex macro
(require 'repl)
@ftindex repl
(repl:top-level macro:eval)

@section Extra-SLIB Packages

Several Scheme packages have been written using SLIB.  There are several
reasons why a package might not be included in the SLIB distribution:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Because it requires special hardware or software which is not universal.
@item
Because it is large and of limited interest to most Scheme users.
@item
Because it has copying terms different enough from the other SLIB
packages that its inclusion would cause confusion.
@item
Because it is an application program, rather than a library module.
@item
Because I have been too busy to integrate it.
@end itemize

Once an optional package is installed (and an entry added to
@code{*catalog*}, the @code{require} mechanism allows it to be called up
and used as easily as any other SLIB package.  Some optional packages
(for which @code{*catalog*} already has entries) available from SLIB

@section Installation


@ifset html
<A NAME="Installation">
@end ifset
@ifset html
</A>
@end ifset

Check the manifest in @file{README} to find a configuration file for
your Scheme implementation.  Initialization files for most IEEE P1178
compliant Scheme Implementations are included with this distribution.

If the Scheme implementation supports @code{getenv}, then the value of
the shell environment variable @var{SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH} will be used
for @code{(library-vicinity)} if it is defined.  Currently, Chez, Elk,
MITScheme, scheme->c, VSCM, and SCM support @code{getenv}.  Scheme48
supports @code{getenv} but does not use it for determining
@code{library-vicinity}.  (That is done from the Makefile.)

You should check the definitions of @code{software-type},
@code{scheme-implementation-version},
@iftex
@*
@end iftex
@code{implementation-vicinity},
and @code{library-vicinity} in the initialization file.  There are
comments in the file for how to configure it.

Once this is done you can modify the startup file for your Scheme
implementation to @code{load} this initialization file.  SLIB is then
installed.

Multiple implementations of Scheme can all use the same SLIB directory.
Simply configure each implementation's initialization file as outlined
above.

@deftp Implementation SCM
The SCM implementation does not require any initialization file as SLIB
support is already built into SCM.  See the documentation with SCM for
installation instructions.

Disclaimer: The code below is only a quick hack.  If I find some time to
spare I might get around to make some more things work.

You have to provide @file{vscm.init} as an explicit command line
argument.  Since this is not very nice I would recommend the following
installation procedure:

@enumerate
@item
run scheme
@item
@code{(load "vscm.init")}
@item
@code{(slib:dump "dumpfile")}
@item
mv dumpfile place-where-vscm-standard-bootfile-resides
e.g. mv dumpfile /usr/local/vscm/lib/scheme-boot
(In this case vscm should have been compiled with flag
-DDEFAULT_BOOTFILE='"/usr/local/vscm/lib/scheme-boot"'.  See Makefile
(definition of DDP) for details.)
@end enumerate

@end deftp

@deftp Implementation Scheme48
To make a Scheme48 image for an installation under @code{<prefix>},

@enumerate
@item
@code{cd} to the SLIB directory
@item
type @code{make prefix=<prefix> slib48}.
@item
To install the image, type @code{make prefix=<prefix> install48}.  This
will also create a shell script with the name @code{slib48} which will
invoke the saved image.
@end enumerate

We distribute an SLIB init file for our system.  If you have PLT Scheme
(our preferred name for the entire suite, which includes DrScheme,
MzScheme and other implementations) installed, you ought to be able to
run @dfn{help-desk}, or run @samp{drscheme} and choose Help Desk from
the Help menu; in Help Desk, type @samp{slib}.  This will give
instructions for how to load the SLIB init file.
@end deftp


@node Porting, Coding Guidelines, Installation, About SLIB
@section Porting

If there is no initialization file for your Scheme implementation, you
will have to create one.  Your Scheme implementation must be largely
compliant with @cite{IEEE Std 1178-1990}, @cite{Revised^4 Report on the
Algorithmic Language Scheme}, or @cite{Revised^5 Report on the
Algorithmic Language Scheme} in order to support SLIB.  @footnote{If you
are porting a @cite{Revised^3 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme}
implementation, then you will need to finish writing @file{sc4sc3.scm}
and @code{load} it from your initialization file.}

@file{Template.scm} is an example configuration file.  The comments
inside will direct you on how to customize it to reflect your system.
Give your new initialization file the implementation's name with
@file{.init} appended.  For instance, if you were porting
@code{foo-scheme} then the initialization file might be called
@file{foo.init}.

Your customized version should then be loaded as part of your scheme
implementation's initialization.  It will load @file{require.scm} from
the library; this will allow the use of @code{provide},
@code{provided?}, and @code{require} along with the @dfn{vicinity}
functions (these functions are documented in the section @ref{Require}).
The rest of the library will then be accessible in a system independent
fashion.

Please mail new working configuration files to @code{jaffer @@ ai.mit.edu}
so that they can be included in the SLIB distribution.


@node Coding Guidelines, Copyrights, Porting, About SLIB
@section Coding Guidelines

All library packages are written in IEEE P1178 Scheme and assume that a
configuration file and @file{require.scm} package have already been
loaded.  Other versions of Scheme can be supported in library packages
as well by using, for example, @code{(provided? 'rev3-report)} or
@code{(require 'rev3-report)} (@pxref{Require}).
@ftindex rev3-report

The module name and @samp{:} should prefix each symbol defined in the
package.  Definitions for external use should then be exported by having
@code{(define foo module-name:foo)}.

Code submitted for inclusion in SLIB should not duplicate routines
already in SLIB files.  Use @code{require} to force those library
routines to be used by your package.  Care should be taken that there
are no circularities in the @code{require}s and @code{load}s between the
library packages.

Documentation should be provided in Emacs Texinfo format if possible,
But documentation must be provided.

Your package will be released sooner with SLIB if you send me a file
which tests your code.  Please run this test @emph{before} you send me
the code!

@subheading Modifications

Please document your changes.  A line or two for @file{ChangeLog} is
sufficient for simple fixes or extensions.  Look at the format of
@file{ChangeLog} to see what information is desired.  Please send me
@code{diff} files from the latest SLIB distribution (remember to send
@code{diff}s of @file{slib.texi} and @file{ChangeLog}).  This makes for
less email traffic and makes it easier for me to integrate when more
than one person is changing a file (this happens a lot with
@file{slib.texi} and @samp{*.init} files).

If someone else wrote a package you want to significantly modify, please
try to contact the author, who may be working on a new version.  This
will insure against wasting effort on obsolete versions.

Please @emph{do not} reformat the source code with your favorite
beautifier, make 10 fixes, and send me the resulting source code.  I do
not have the time to fish through 10000 diffs to find your 10 real fixes.

@section Copyrights

@ifset html
<A NAME="Copyrights">

@end ifset

This section has instructions for SLIB authors regarding copyrights.

Each package in SLIB must either be in the public domain, or come with a
statement of terms permitting users to copy, redistribute and modify it.
The comments at the beginning of @file{require.scm} and
@file{macwork.scm} illustrate copyright and appropriate terms.

If your code or changes amount to less than about 10 lines, you do not
need to add your copyright or send a disclaimer.

@subheading Putting code into the Public Domain

In order to put code in the public domain you should sign a copyright
disclaimer and send it to the SLIB maintainer.  Contact
jaffer @@ ai.mit.edu for the address to mail the disclaimer to.

@quotation
I, @var{name}, hereby affirm that I have placed the software package
@var{name} in the public domain.

I affirm that I am the sole author and sole copyright holder for the
software package, that I have the right to place this software package
in the public domain, and that I will do nothing to undermine this
status in the future.

@flushright
                                        @var{signature and date}
@end flushright
@end quotation

This wording assumes that you are the sole author.  If you are not the
sole author, the wording needs to be different.  If you don't want to be
bothered with sending a letter every time you release or modify a
module, make your letter say that it also applies to your future
revisions of that module.

Make sure no employer has any claim to the copyright on the work you are
submitting.  If there is any doubt, create a copyright disclaimer and
have your employer sign it.  Mail the signed disclaimer to the SLIB
maintainer.  Contact jaffer @@ ai.mit.edu for the address to mail the
disclaimer to.  An example disclaimer follows.

@subheading Explicit copying terms

@noindent
If you submit more than about 10 lines of code which you are not placing
into the Public Domain (by sending me a disclaimer) you need to:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Arrange that your name appears in a copyright line for the appropriate
year.   Multiple copyright lines are acceptable.
@item
With your copyright line, specify any terms you require to be different
from those already in the file.
@item
Make sure no employer has any claim to the copyright on the work you are
submitting.  If there is any doubt, create a copyright disclaimer and
have your employer sign it.  Mail the signed disclaim to the SLIB
maintainer.  Contact jaffer @@ ai.mit.edu for the address to mail the
disclaimer to.
@end itemize

@subheading Example: Company Copyright Disclaimer

This disclaimer should be signed by a vice president or general manager
of the company.  If you can't get at them, anyone else authorized to
license out software produced there will do.  Here is a sample wording:

@quotation
@var{employer} Corporation hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program @var{program} written by @var{name}.

@var{employer} Corporation affirms that it has no other intellectual
property interest that would undermine this release, and will do nothing
to undermine it in the future.
