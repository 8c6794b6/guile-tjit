;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; A linker combines several linker objects into an executable or a
;;; loadable library.
;;;
;;; There are several common formats for libraries out there.  Since
;;; Guile includes its own linker and loader, we are free to choose any
;;; format, or make up our own.
;;;
;;; There are essentially two requirements for a linker format:
;;; libraries should be able to be loaded with the minimal amount of
;;; work; and they should support introspection in some way, in order to
;;; enable good debugging.
;;;
;;; These requirements are somewhat at odds, as loading should not have
;;; to stumble over features related to introspection.  It so happens
;;; that a lot of smart people have thought about this situation, and
;;; the ELF format embodies the outcome of their thinking.  Guile uses
;;; ELF as its format, regardless of the platform's native library
;;; format.  It's not inconceivable that Guile could interoperate with
;;; the native dynamic loader at some point, but it's not a near-term
;;; goal.
;;;
;;; Guile's linker takes a list of objects, sorts them according to
;;; similarity from the perspective of the loader, then writes them out
;;; into one big bytevector in ELF format.
;;;
;;; It is often the case that different parts of a library need to refer
;;; to each other.  For example, program text may need to refer to a
;;; constant from writable memory.  When the linker places sections
;;; (linker objects) into specific locations in the linked bytevector,
;;; it needs to fix up those references.  This process is called
;;; /relocation/.  References needing relocations are recorded in
;;; "linker-reloc" objects, and collected in a list in each
;;; "linker-object".  The actual definitions of the references are
;;; stored in "linker-symbol" objects, also collected in a list in each
;;; "linker-object".
;;;
;;; By default, the ELF files created by the linker include some padding
;;; so that different parts of the file can be loaded in with different
;;; permissions.  For example, some parts of the file are read-only and
;;; thus can be shared between processes.  Some parts of the file don't
;;; need to be loaded at all.  However this padding can be too much for
;;; interactive compilation, when the code is never written out to disk;
;;; in that case, pass #:page-aligned? #f to `link-elf'.

is known.  There is special support for patching up the segment table,
however.  Because the segment table needs to know the segment sizes,
which is the difference between two symbols in image space, and there is
no reloc kind that is the difference between two symbols, we make a hack
and return a closure that patches up segment table entries.  It seems to
work.

Returns two values: the procedure to patch the segment table, and the
list of objects, augmented with objects for the special ELF sections."
