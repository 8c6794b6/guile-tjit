;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; (web client) is a simple HTTP URL fetcher for Guile.
;;;
;;; In its current incarnation, (web client) is synchronous.  If you
;;; want to fetch a number of URLs at once, probably the best thing to
;;; do is to write an event-driven URL fetcher, similar in structure to
;;; the web server.
;;;
;;; Another option, good but not as performant, would be to use threads,
;;; possibly via a thread pool.
