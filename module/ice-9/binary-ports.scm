;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; The I/O port API of the R6RS is provided by this module.  In many areas
;;; it complements or refines Guile's own historical port API.  For instance,
;;; it allows for binary I/O with bytevectors.
;;;
;;; Code:

(define-module (ice-9 binary-ports)
  #:use-module (rnrs bytevectors)
  #:export (eof-object
            open-bytevector-input-port
            make-custom-binary-input-port
            get-u8
            lookahead-u8
            get-bytevector-n
            get-bytevector-n!
            get-bytevector-some
            get-bytevector-all
            get-string-n!
            put-u8
            put-bytevector
            unget-bytevector
            open-bytevector-output-port
            make-custom-binary-output-port))

;; Note that this extension also defines %make-transcoded-port, which is
;; not exported but is used by (rnrs io ports).
