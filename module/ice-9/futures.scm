;;; Author: Ludovic Court√®s <ludo@gnu.org>
;;;
;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This module provides an implementation of futures, a mechanism for
;;; fine-grain parallelism.  Futures were first described by Henry Baker
;;; in ``The Incremental Garbage Collection of Processes'', 1977, and
;;; then implemented in MultiLisp (an implicit variant thereof, i.e.,
;;; without `touch'.)
;;;
;;; This modules uses a fixed thread pool, normally one per CPU core.
;;; Futures are off-loaded to these threads, when they are idle.
;;;
