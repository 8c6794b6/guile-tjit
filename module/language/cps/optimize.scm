    ;; let*-bound variable to the same slot, which also means that the
    ;; garbage collector doesn't have to retain so many copies of the
    ;; term being optimized.  However during bootstrap, the interpreter
    ;; doesn't do this optimization, leading to excessive data retention
    ;; as the terms are rewritten.  To marginally improve bootstrap
    ;; memory usage, here we use set! instead.  The compiler should
    ;; produce the same code in any case, though currently it does not
    ;; because it doesn't do escape analysis on the box created for the
    ;; set!.
