; catch and throw can mainly be implemented directly using Guile's

; within Guile must be symbols, while elisp allows any value and checks
; for matches using eq (eq?).  We handle this by using always #t as key
; for the Guile primitives and check for matches inside the handler; if
; the elisp keys are not eq?, we rethrow the exception.
