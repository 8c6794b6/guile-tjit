; This module defines routines to handle analysis of symbol bindings used
; during elisp compilation.  This data allows to collect the symbols, for
; which globals need to be created, or mark certain symbols as lexically bound.

; Needed globals are stored in an association-list that stores a list of symbols
; for each module they are needed in.

; The lexical bindings of symbols are stored in a hash-table that associates
; symbols to fluids; those fluids are used in the with-lexical-binding and
; with-dynamic-binding routines to associate symbols to different bindings
; over a dynamic extent.

; Record type used to hold the data necessary.
