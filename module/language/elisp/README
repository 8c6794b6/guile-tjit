Guile's Emacs Lisp compiler
===========================

This is more or less a lot of work in progress.  Here are some notes as well
as status information.

Already implemented:
  * progn
  * if, cond
  * and, or
  * quote
  * referencing and setting (setq) variables
  * while
  * let, let*
  * lambda expressions, function calls using list notation

Especially still missing:
  * other progX forms, will be done in macros
  * where, unless, will be done in macros
  * dolist, dotimes using macros
  * catch/throw, unwind-protect
  * real elisp reader instead of Scheme's
  * set, makunbound, boundp functions
  * macros
  * general primitives (+, -, *, cons, ...)
  * funcall and apply
  * fset & friends
  * defvar, defun
