Guile's Emacs Lisp compiler
===========================

This is more or less a lot of work in progress.  Here are some notes as well
as status information.

Already implemented:
  * progn
  * if, cond
  * and
  * quote

Especially still missing:
  * other progX forms, will be done in macros
  * where, unless, will be done in macros
  * or
  * while, other loops using macros
  * catch/throw, unwind-protect
  * real elisp reader instead of Scheme's
  * handling of variables: setq, referencing, let -- using fluids for scoping
  * macros
  * general primitives (+, -, *, cons, ...)
  * functions, lambdas
