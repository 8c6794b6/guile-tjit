;;; This module provides an abstraction around Guile's low level trap
;;; handler interface; its aim is to make the low level trap mechanism
;;; shareable between the debugger and other applications, and to
;;; insulate the rest of the debugger code a bit from changes that may
;;; occur in the low level trap interface in future.

;;; The current low level traps interface is as follows.
;;;
;;; All trap handlers are subject to SCM_TRAPS_P, which is controlled
;;; by the `traps' setting of `(evaluator-traps-interface)' but also
;;; (and more relevant in most cases) by the `with-traps' procedure.
;;; Basically, `with-traps' sets SCM_TRAPS_P to 1 during execution of
;;; its thunk parameter.
;;;
;;; Note that all trap handlers are called with SCM_TRAPS_P set to 0
;;; for the duration of the call, to avoid nasty recursive trapping
;;; loops.  If a trap handler knows what it is doing, it can override
;;; this by `(trap-enable traps)'.
;;;
;;; The apply-frame handler is called when Guile is about to perform
;;; an application if EITHER the `apply-frame' evaluator trap option
;;; is set, OR the `trace' debug option is set and the procedure to
;;; apply has its `trace' procedure property set.  The arguments
;;; passed are:
;;;
;;; - the symbol 'apply-frame
;;;
;;; - a continuation or debug object describing the current stack
;;;
;;; - a boolean indicating whether the application is tail-recursive.
;;;
;;; The enter-frame handler is called when the evaluator begins a new
;;; evaluation frame if EITHER the `enter-frame' evaluator trap option
;;; is set, OR the `breakpoints' debug option is set and the code to
;;; be evaluated has its `breakpoint' source property set.  The
;;; arguments passed are:
;;;
;;; - the symbol 'enter-frame
;;;
;;; - a continuation or debug object describing the current stack
;;;
;;; - a boolean indicating whether the application is tail-recursive.
;;;
;;; - an unmemoized copy of the expression to be evaluated.
;;;
;;; If the `enter-frame' evaluator trap option is set, the enter-frame
;;; handler is also called when about to perform an application in
;;; SCM_APPLY, immediately before possible calling the apply-frame
;;; handler.  (I don't totally understand this.)  In this case, the
;;; arguments passed are:
;;;
;;; - the symbol 'enter-frame
;;;
;;; - a continuation or debug object describing the current stack.
;;;
;;; The exit-frame handler is called when Guile exits an evaluation
;;; frame (in SCM_CEVAL) or an application frame (in SCM_APPLY), if
;;; EITHER the `exit-frame' evaluator trap option is set, OR the
;;; `trace' debug option is set and the frame is marked as having been
;;; traced.  The frame will be marked as having been traced if the
;;; apply-frame handler was called for this frame.  (This is trickier
;;; than it sounds because of tail recursion: the same debug frame
;;; could have been used for multiple applications, only some of which
;;; were traced - I think.)  The arguments passed are:
;;;
;;; - the symbol 'exit-frame
;;;
;;; - a continuation or debug object describing the current stack
;;;
;;; - the result of the evaluation or application.

;;; {Stack IDs}
;;;
;;; Mechanism for limiting trapping to contexts whose stack ID matches
;;; one of a registered set.  The default set up is to limit trapping
;;; to events in the contexts of the Guile REPL and of file loading.
