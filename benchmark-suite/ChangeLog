	* benchmarks/0-reference.bm:  Added as a reference benchmark to be
	used to calibrate iteration counts.

	* lib.scm: Added documentation.  Added some initialization
	messages.

	(benchmark-time-base, benchmark-total-time, benchmark-user-time,
	benchmark-system-time, benchmark-frame-time, benchmark-core-time,
	benchmark-user-time\interpreter, benchmark-core-time\interpreter):
	Exported.

	(benchmark-time-base, time-base): Renamed time-base to
	benchmark-time-base and introduced new time-base as a short-cut.

	(total-time, benchmark-total-time, user-time, benchmark-user-time,
	system-time, benchmark-system-time, frame-time,
	benchmark-frame-time, benchmark-time, benchmark-core-time,
	user-time\interpreter, benchmark-user-time\interpreter,
	benchmark-time\interpreter, benchmark-core-time\interpreter,
	print-result, print-user-result):  Renamed <foo>-time to
	benchmark-<foo>-time.  Exceptions: benchmark-time and
	benchmark-time\interpreter were renamed to benchmark-core-time and
	benchmark-core-time\interpreter, respectively.

	* COPYING, README, Makefile.am, lib.scm, guile-benchmark:  Copied
	from the test-suite directory, renamed and adapted for use with
	benchmarks.

	* benchmarks/logand.bm, benchmarks/continuations.bm,
	benchmarks/if.bm:  Added as initial fairly stupid examples for
	benchmarks.
