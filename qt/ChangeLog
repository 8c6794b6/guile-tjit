Wed Aug 27 17:43:38 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

 	dynamic linking support for Irix 6 as well as Irix 5.  Thanks to

Wed Jul 23 20:32:42 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurf@zafir.e.kth.se>

Sun Apr 27 18:00:06 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* aclocal.m4: Removed; unnecessary, given changes of Apr 24.

Thu Apr 24 01:37:49 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Get 'make dist' to work again.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove PLUGIN files.

	sultry sailors.

	Changes for reduced Guile distribution: one configure script,
	no plugins.

Tue Apr 15 17:46:54 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* PLUGIN/OPT: Don't mention "threads", because that causes
	"threads" to appear in the list of directories to be configured.
	Just say enough to get qt to appear in the list.  I don't think qt
	needs to be built before or after anything else in particular...

Mon Feb 24 21:47:16 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

Sun Feb  9 15:20:59 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	We need to name the object files produced from the
	machine-dependent C and assembler files qtmds.o and qtmdc.o, but
	using -c and -o together on the cc command line isn't portable.
	* configure.in: Generate the names of the .o files here, and
	substitute them into Makefile.
	* Makefile.am (qtmds.o, qtmdc.o): Let CC name them what it wants,
	and then rename them when it's done.
	(configure, Makefile.in): Regenerated.

Sat Nov 30 23:59:06 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

Sun Nov 10 17:40:47 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: The 'install' and 'uninstall'
 	Makefile targets should be affected by whether or not we have a
 	port to the current target architecture too, not just the 'all'
 	target.

Wed Oct  9 19:40:13 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: If we don't have a port to the current machine,
 	just arrange for 'make all' to do nothing.  Don't abort
 	configuration.  We need a fully configured directory tree in order
 	to make distributions and the like.

	* Makefile.in (distfiles): Update for the new directory structure.
	(plugin_distfiles, md_distfiles, time_distfiles): New variables.
	(dist-dir): New target; use all the above to build a subtree of a
	distribution.
	(manifest): Target deleted.

Tue Oct  1 02:06:19 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>
