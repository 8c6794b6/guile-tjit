	* configure.in, Makefile.in: The 'install' and 'uninstall'
 	Makefile targets should be affected by whether or not we have a
 	port to the current target architecture too, not just the 'all'
 	target.

Wed Oct  9 19:40:13 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: If we don't have a port to the current machine,
 	just arrange for 'make all' to do nothing.  Don't abort
 	configuration.  We need a fully configured directory tree in order
 	to make distributions and the like.

	* Makefile.in (distfiles): Update for the new directory structure.
	(plugin_distfiles, md_distfiles, time_distfiles): New variables.
	(dist-dir): New target; use all the above to build a subtree of a
	distribution.
	(manifest): Target deleted.

	* configure.in: Solaris 2 should use sparc.s.
	*Older* systems use _sparc.s
