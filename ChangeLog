1999-02-12  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* configure.in: Add --with-readline flag.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

1999-02-09  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* NEWS: Added entry for optargs module.

1999-02-06  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure: Regenerated using autoconf 2.12.

1999-01-26  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Removed test AC_C_BIGENDIAN.  (This test was
	considered to encourage bad coding style.)

1999-01-21  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Added test AC_C_BIGENDIAN.

1999-01-11  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Remove quotes around ac_cv_lib_readline_main and
 	ac_cv_var_rl_getc_function.  They should both always be set to
	non-null values; this way, we get error messages.
	* configure: Regenerated.

1999-01-10  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* configure.in: Cite the variable ac_cv_lib_readline_main, not
	ac_cv_lib_readline_readline; the latter isn't set any more, since
	we look for 'main' in libreadline now.  Add quotes around
	reference to the variable references, too, so this will work even
	when a variable's value is the empty string.
	* configure: Regenerated.

1999-01-07  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* acconfig.h: Added HAVE_LONG_LONGS.

	* configure.in: Added AC_CHECK_SIZEOF(long), AC_CHECK_SIZEOF(int);
	Added check for long longs.

1998-12-14  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Check for tgoto in ncurses, then termcap.
  	S.u.S.E. Linux doesn't have a termcap.  (Thanks to Karl
 	Eichwalder.)
	* configure: Regenerated.

1998-10-24  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Call AM_PROG_CC_STDC, to see what flags we should
	pass the compiler to make it support ANSI.  (Thanks to Bernard
	Urban.)
	* aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated.

1998-10-20  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* Guile 1.3 released.

1998-10-19  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* GUILE-VERSION: Bump to 1.3.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Don't omit ANON-CVS and SNAPSHOTS.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

1998-10-16  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* qthreads.m4 (QTHREADS_CONFIGURE): On NetBSD, pass through a flag
 	to the Makefile which explicitly tells it to pass assembly files
 	through the preprocessor.  (Thanks to Perry Metzger.)
	* aclocal.m4, configure, Makefile.in: Regenerated.

1998-10-14  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Define SCM_SINGLES whenever a float can fit in a
	long, not only when a float is the same size as a long.  This gets
	us SCM_SINGLES defined on alphas.  (Thanks to Clark McGrew.)
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* configure.in: Construct libguile/versiondat.h here; see
	log entry in libguile/ChangeLog for details.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* configure.in: Allow tabs and whitespace between `void' and
	`usleep'.  (Thanks to Harvey J. Stein.)
	* configure: Regenerated.

	Don't redefine sleep/usleep.
	* configure.in: Remove tests for usleep's argument type; we only
	need that if we're going to replace it.

	* acconfig.h (USLEEP_ARG_TYPE): Delete.  All the other SLEEP
	garbage is needed just to use usleep and sleep without compiler
	warnings.
	* configure: Regenerated.

1998-10-12  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure: Regenerated.
	
	* configure.in (GUILE_FUNC_DECLARED): Name the cache variables
	starting with guile_cv_; ac_cv_ is autoconf's namespace.

	The type of the argument to usleep varies from system to system,
	as does the return type.  We really shouldn't be redefining usleep
	at all, but I don't have time to clean that up before the 1.3
	release.  It's on the schedule for afterwards.
	* configure.in: Cache results from usleep return value test.
	Test for the type of the usleep argument, and cache that too.
	* acconfig.h (USLEEP_ARG_TYPE): New macro.

1998-10-11  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* acconfig.h (HAVE_RL_GETC_FUNCTION): Fix this entry.

1998-10-10  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* GUILE-VERSION: bump to 1.2.91, since we're doing snapshots again.

	* Guile 1.2.90 released --- beta.
	* GUILE-VERSION: Set to 1.2.90.  This would appear to be a
 	regression from 1.3a, but everyone knows that the next release is
 	1.3, I want to switch to a more coherent version numbering system,
 	and now is the time.
	
1998-10-09  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Call AC_C_INLINE, so we can use inline happily in
	libguile. 
	* configure: Regenerated.

1998-10-07  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Don't forget to #define HAVE_RL_GETC_FUNCTION if
	we do find the rl_getc_function variable in the readline library;
	AC_CHECK_FUNCS used to do this for us, but we're not using it any
	more.
	* acconfig.h: Add an entry for HAVE_RL_GETC_FUNCTION.

	* configure.in: Properly test for the presence of rl_getc_function;
	it's a variable, not a function.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* doc: New subdirectory.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): List it.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Build its Makefile.
	* configure, Makefile.in: Regenerated.

	* guile.m4 (GUILE_FLAGS): New macro.

	* guile.m4 (AM_INIT_GUILE_MODULE): Deleted; it doesn't do anything
 	terribly helpful any more, nobody's using it, and this is not
 	really the way I want to handle modules anyway.

1998-10-03  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in (FD_SETTER, FILE_CNT_GPTR): New cases for SCO's
	stdio implementation.  (Thanks to David Tillman.)
	* configure: Rebuilt.
	
	* guile-config: Renamed from `build'.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Mention `guile-config', not `build'.
	* configure.in: Create `guile-config/Makefile.in', not
	`build/Makefile.in'.  Doc fix, too.

	* qthreads.m4: Doc fix.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Regeneranegerederadea.

1998-10-03    <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* configure.in: Check for a missing `sleep' declaration.
	* acconfig.h (MISSING_SLEEP_DECL): Provide some text for this.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* configure.in: Don't use the canonical host name to decide
	whether `bzero' and `usleep' have declarations --- that's going
	back to the bad old days before autoconf.  Remove the call to
	AC_CANONICAL_HOST and the subsequent case statement.
	(GUILE_FUNC_DECLARED): New m4 macro.  Use it to check for
	declarations for `bzero', `usleep', and (new!) `strptime'.
	* acconfig.h: (DECLARE_BZERO, DECLARE_USLEEP): Removed.
	(MISSING_BZERO_DECL, MISSING_USLEEP_DECL, MISSING_STRPTIME_DECL):
	Added.  I think this naming convention is more consistent with the
	rest of autoconf; names generally describes the system, not what
	the package should do to accomodate the system.
	* configure: Regenerated.

1998-09-05  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Remove --disable-debug option.  The debugging
	support is pretty stable now, and it's confusing people.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* HACKING: Remove -Wstrict-prototypes from the list of requested
	flags (to match 1998-07-30 change).

1998-07-30  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Don't use -Wstrict-prototypes after all.
	* configure: Regenerated.

1998-07-29  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Request more warnings.
	* configure: Regenerated.
	* HACKING: Ask people not to make changes that introduce those
	warnings.  Now I have to go through the code and actually bring it
	up to standards... :(

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated using the last
 	public version of automake, not the hacked Cygnus version.
	* config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh: New versions from
 	libtool.
	
	* configure.in, qthreads.m4: Display a message about how the
 	threads configuration went.
	* aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated.
	
1998-07-28  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	Remove the TOTORO kludge.  We're not doing snapshots any more, so
	totoro is completely uninvolved.  (Poor Totoro!)
	* configure.in: Remove code to check the hostname and #define
	TOTORO.
	* acconfig.h: Remove comments for TOTORO symbol.
	* configure, Makefile.in: Regenerated.

	* qthreads.m4 (QTHREADS_CONFIGURE): We *can* use AC_REQUIRE here
	to get AC_PROG_LN_S.
	* aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated.

1998-07-26  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	Clean up thread configuration.
	* qthreads.m4: New file, which knows how to configure the qthreads
	library.
	* configure.in: Replace all thread package selection code.  Do the
 	--with-threads argument processing here.  Enable the appropriate
 	thread interface files in libguile.  Remove all qthreads
 	configuration code; call QTHREADS_CONFIGURE instead.  Set
 	GUILE_LIBS using the info provided by QTHREADS_CONFIGURE.
	* threads.m4: Removed; not used any more.
	* Makefile.am (aclocal_DATA): Mention qthreads.m4, not threads.m4.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Rgnrtd.  (Sv th vwls!)
	Note that these were regenerated with the tools available from
	Cygnus's source tree, which have patches not available to the
	general public.  I'm not sure this was a good idea; feel free to
	revert them to the latest released versions of the tools.

	Upgrade to the version of libtool available at Cygnus.  See note
	above.
	* config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh: Upgraded.

1998-07-12  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Changed variable HOSTNAME --> PROG_HOSTNAME in
	totoro kludge.

1998-05-11  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Added test for rl_getc_function.  Warn if
	libreadline is found but not this function.

1998-05-06  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Replaced some AC_CHECK_FUNC --> AC_CHECK_FUNCS so
	that suitable HAVE_<function name> symbols get defined.

1998-04-25  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* configure.in: Define USLEEP_RETURNS_VOID on some systems.
	(Thanks to Julian Satchell.)

1998-04-20  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Check for usleep;  Define DECLARE_BZERO and
	DECLARE_USLEEP on Solaris 2.5 since it supplies those functions
	without declaring them.

	* acconfig.h: Added DECLARE_BZERO, DECLARE_USLEEP

1998-04-19  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Define HAVE_DLOPEN also when HAVE_LIBDL is
	defined.

	* configure.in (GUILE_LIBS): New variable.  Contains libraries
	which libguile needs to be linked with.  Substituted into
	libpath.h.

	* threads.m4 (threads_package): Don't add $LDFLAGS and $LIBS to
	$cy_cv_threads_libs.

1998-04-11  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	New libtool: 1.2
	* ltconfig, ltmain.sh, config.sub, config.guess: Updated.

	* acconfig.h: Add USCORE.

1997-11-27  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	which have the necessary functions (gettimeofday, select).

	* acconfig.h: Added GUILE_ISELECT.

1997-11-24  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Assume dlsym does not add underscore if
 	cross-compiling.
	* aclocal.m4, configure: Regenderated.

1997-11-21  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

1997-10-26  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* README (libtool): Tell people to use version 1.0e.

Sat Oct 25 02:50:43 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	Call the QuickThreads library libqthreads.a, not libqt.a.  The old
	name conflicts with the Qt user interface toolkit.
	* threads.m4 (CY_AC_WITH_THREADS): Use new library name.
	* configure.in: Same.
	* aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated.

Thu Oct 23 00:58:06 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* configure.in: Check for the readline library, and the termcap
	library (on which readline relies).
	* configure: Regenerated.

Wed Oct 22 16:55:57 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	New libtool: 1.0e

	* configure.in: Add build/Makefile to AC_OUTPUT clause.
	* Makefile.in, configure: Regenerated.

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4: Regenerated with automake 1.2a.

Tue Sep 16 00:19:46 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* README, ltconfig, ltmain.sh: New libtool: 1.0c.

Thu Sep 11 11:28:24 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* ltmain.sh: Added a missing '\' before \n on line 32.

Thu Aug 28 23:40:43 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	New libtool: 1.0b.
	* ltconfig, ltmain.sh, config.guess: Freshly libtoolized.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated, salamander-style.

Wed Aug 27 11:35:09 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.in: Regenerated, so it uses "tar", not "gtar".

	* configure.in: Use the QuickThreads assembler fragment with Irix
	dynamic linking support for Irix 6 as well as Irix 5.  Thanks to
	Jesse Glick.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sun Aug 24 15:51:12 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* acinclude.m4 (GUILE_NAMED_CHECK_FUNC): New macro: Tagged test,
	so that test for the same function can be performed multiple
	times.

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Test for rxposix.h,
	rx/rxposix.h.  Add library rx only if regcomp can't be found
	without it.

	* acconfig.h (HAVE_REGCOMP): Added it here since autoheader misses
	it for some reason!

Fri Aug 22 21:21:49 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.red-bean.com>

	* THANKS: New file.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated.

Wed Jul 23 20:24:27 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <djurf@zafir.e.kth.se>

	configure: Regenerated.

Thu Jul 17 07:56:05 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* configure.in: use AC_CHECK_FUNCS for sethostent etc.,
	so scmconfig.h is updated with the test results.  this may
	disable one of the cygwin hacks.

Fri Jul 11 00:18:19 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.red-bean.com>

	Changes to compile under gnu-win32, from Marcus Daniels:
	* configure.in: When sys/un.h exists, define HAVE_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS
	to indicate that Unix domain sockets will work.
	Check for socketpair, getgroups, setwent, pause, and tzset
	(cygwin currently lacks these them).
	Check for sethostent endhostent getnetent setnetent endnetent
	getprotoent endprotoent getservent endservent getnetbyaddr
	getnetbyname inet_lnaof inet_makeaddr inet_netof (cygwin currently
	lacks them).  In the case of cygwin, temporarily prefix these
	functions with "cygwin32_", the way that netdb.h does.
	Don't define HAVE_REGCOMP unless both regcomp and regex.h are
	available (cygwin b18 came distributed without a working regex.h
	file).
	* acconfig.h (HAVE_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS): Add this.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Wed Jul  2 12:28:40 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	* ltmain.sh: Remove any trailing colon on $shlibpath_var
	(i.e. LD_LIBRARY_PATH) for braindamaged linkers that choke on it.
	Patch sent to bug-libtool.

Sat Jun 28 16:13:43 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	* configure.in: Add alloca.o explicitly to LIBOBJS (thanks Eric

	come first.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Tue Jun 24 13:34:20 1997  Tim Pierce  <twpierce@bio-5.bsd.uchicago.edu>

	* aclocal.m4 (AM_PATH_PROG_LD): Change `ac_cv_path_LD' typo to
	`am_cv_path_LD'.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sun Jun 22 15:43:07 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.red-bean.com>

	Try to detect when people are using one version of libguile and a
	different version of ice-9.  People have been skewing things and
	sending in bug reports.
	* configure.in: Provide libguile its version information through a
 	separate header file generated by the Makefile, not through
 	scmconfig.h.  
	(GUILE_MAJOR_VERSION, GUILE_MINOR_VERSION, GUILE_VERSION):
	AC_SUBST these, instead of AC_DEFINE'ing them.
	(GUILE_STAMP): New AC_SUBST: the time we configured the tree.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Create ice-9/version.scm.
	* acconfig.h (GUILE_MAJOR_VERSION, GUILE_MINOR_VERSION,
	GUILE_VERSION): Deleted.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

	* aclocal.m4: Regenerated, using the libtool 0.9h m4 macros.

	* ltconfig, ltmain.sh: libtoolized, using libtool 0.9h.

Wed Jun 11 00:34:01 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.red-bean.com>

	* ltconfig, ltmain.sh, config.guess: New files from libtool 0.9g.

	* configure.in: By default, include functions in Guile to allow
 	linking with dynamic libraries at run-time.  In other words,
	--enable-dynamic-linking is now the default.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

	* configure.in: Remove space between AC_CHECK_LIB and opening
	paren in check for Rx.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* configure.in: Remove all mention of xtra_PLUGIN_guile_libs.
	It's never used.
	* configure, Makefile.in: Regenerated.

Tue Jun 10 23:37:12 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.red-bean.com>

	* configure.in: Move checks for libraries (-lm, -lnsl, -lsocket,
	-dl, -dld) before checks for functions.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon Jun  9 02:35:46 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	* config.guess: New copy from autoconf-2.12, which recognizes
	OpenBSD.

Tue Jun  3 16:34:19 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Check for Rx, so we will use its routines (which I
	pretty much trust) if it is installed.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sat May 31 03:48:45 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* acconfig.h: mention HAVE_RESTARTS.
	* configure.in: check for sigaction and restartable system calls.

Tue May 27 22:47:52 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	* configure.in: Check for presence of regcomp.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon May 26 12:14:20 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* COPYING: New address for FSF.

	* configure.in: We don't need to add fileblocks.o to LIBOBJS if
 	struct stat doesn't have the st_blocks field.  We take care of
 	that case in the code.  Replace AC_STRUCT_ST_BLOCKS with its
 	definition, edited appropriately.  (Bernard URBAN)
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sat May 17 13:49:28 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Don't link against -lnsl or -lsocket unless we
	actually need to.  This causes trouble on Irix.  (Thanks to Larry
	Schwimmer.)

	* config.sub: Get newer version, that recognizes the i686.

Fri May 16 17:26:10 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* README: Changed Mikael's threads work attribution in order
	to sooth Anthony's enormous, but wounded, ego.

Fri May 16 17:26:53 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Just kidding!!!

Fri May 16 04:24:48 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Guile 1.1 released.
	* GUILE-VERSION: Bump to 1.1.

Tue May 13 16:34:40 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Switch to automake-1.1p.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated.

Mon May 12 18:29:45 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* threads.m4: Copy Anthony's change here, so it'll actually
	survive.

Thu May  8 11:48:40 1997  Anthony Green  <green@hoser.cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4: Fixes for building with coop threads in a 
	seperate compilation directory.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

Fri May  2 16:24:15 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Upgrade to libtool 0.9e.
	* ltconfig, ltmain.sh, config.guess, config.sub: New versions,
	supplied by libtool.

	* configure.in: When configuring qt, sunos needs the underscore
	files; Solaris and Linux both need the normal files.
	* configure: Reebilt.
	
Thu May  1 15:35:49 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Get the paths for qt's md files right, so it can
 	build correctly when using a separate compilation directory.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Thu Apr 24 01:20:34 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Get threads to work again.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): List libguile last, so qt gets built
	first.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.
	* aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerate, with modern definition of
 	CY_AC_WITH_THREADS.  Where did the old text come from?  Creepy...

	Reduced Guile distribution: one configure script, no plugins.
	* configure.in: Merged the old text from qt/configure.in and
	libguile/configure.in; Tom Tromey says automake only wants one
	configure.in script.  This seems fishy, but...
	* Makefile.am: List the subdirectories explicitly; no more PLUGIN
	gubbish.
	* acconfig.h, acinclude.m4: Moved here from libguile, since
	libguile's configure script lives here now.
	* AUTHORS, INSTALL, README: Updated.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4 configure: Regenerated.  Just like
	amputated amphibian limbs.

	need to link against libthreads; the files it used to contain
	are now a part of libguile.

Sun Apr 13 22:14:10 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* guile.m4: Revert change of Mar 15, and use the new 'no-define'

	* guile.m4 (AM_INIT_GUILE_MODULE): Replaced AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE macro
 	with its definition and commented out definition of PACKAGE.  This
 	changed seemed necessary after having removed PACKAGE from
 	libguile/acconfig.h.

Wed Sep 11 21:11:33 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* lgh/: added the directory in which I implement the high level

Thu Aug 15 19:03:03 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Check for -ldl, so the check for Tcl won't fail
 	spuriously.

Thu Aug 15 01:29:29 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Change the way we decide whether to build gtcltk-lib, so that it's
	omitted from the build process when appropriate, but never from
	the dist process.
	* configure.in: Don't edit all_subdirs depending on the
 	availability of Tk; let that be the list of all PLUGIN
 	subdirectories present, as it used to be.  Instead, edit a new
 	variable, build_subdirs; write its final value, the list of
 	subdirs we do want to compile in, to config.build-subdirs.
  	Substitute that into the top-level Makefile too.
	* Makefile.in (subdirs): Set this to @build_subdirs@, so we only
	recurse on the subdirectories we should build.
	(distdirs): Set this to @existingdirs@, so it includes the subdirs
	we decided not to build.

	* doc/gtcltk.texi: File resurrected from old Guile releases.
	* doc/Makefile.in (info): Build the gtcltk documentation.
	(DIST_FILES): Include it in the distribution.

	* configure.in: If we can find the library for tcl7.5, build
 	gtcltk-lib.  Call AC_PROG_CC, to help run that test with the right
 	compiler (not sure this is necessary).

Mon Aug 12 15:09:37 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Fix bug reporting address.

Fri Aug  9 15:58:42 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* AUTHORS: New file, in accordance with the GNU maintainers'
 	standards.

Tue Aug  6 14:40:44 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	description, and short tour.
 	* INSTALL: Renamed from BUILDING.

	PostScript files.
	(%.ps, %.dvi, %.txt): New targets.
	(DVIPS, TEXI2DVI): New variables.

	* GUILE-VERSION: Updated to 1.0b3.

	Rehashed distribution system, in preparation for nightly
	snapshots.  Other changes in subdirectories.
	* Makefile.in (dist): Rewritten --- the old target was out of
 	date, dependent on files that we don't have, and relied on GNU
 	tar.  The new target is simpler.
	(VERSION, srcdir, dist_dirs): New variables.
	(DISTFILES): Renamed from localfiles.  Added GUILE-VERSION and
	TODO.
	(localtreats): Variable removed.  We don't have this file.
	(info): cd to doc and make info there; don't make info in every
	${subdir}; those Makefiles don't know what to do.
	(distname, distdir, treats, announcefile): Variables removed.
	(manifest-file): Target removed.
	(dist-dir): New target, responsible for distributable files in
	this directory.
	(GZIP, GZIP_EXT, TAR_VERBOSE, DIST_NAME): New variables,
	controlling the 'dist' target.
	* configure.in: Substitute GUILE-VERSION into the top-level
	Makefile.  Build doc/Makefile from doc/Makefile.in.

	* doc/Makefile.in: New file.
