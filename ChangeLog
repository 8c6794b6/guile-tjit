Fri Sep 13 14:39:30 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): added mkinstalldirs to the DISTFILES

	* PLUGIN: changed the PLUGIN/REQ files in the ice-9 and lgh
	directories, to arrange for lgh to the last thing
	configured/built.

Wed Sep 11 21:11:33 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@papageno.lanl.gov>

	* lgh/: added the directory in which I implement the high level
	libguile library (lgh_) for this release of Guile.  See the
	ChangeLog in there for further details.

Thu Sep  5 17:36:15 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (tags): New name for `TAGS' target, which will
	always run the commands.

Thu Sep  5 09:56:50 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* README: Doc fixes.

Fri Aug 30 16:56:27 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (TAGS): Produce a single tags file for all of Guile.

Thu Aug 15 19:03:03 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Check for -ldl, so the check for Tcl won't fail
 	spuriously.

Thu Aug 15 01:29:29 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Change the way we decide whether to build gtcltk-lib, so that it's
	omitted from the build process when appropriate, but never from
	the dist process.
	* configure.in: Don't edit all_subdirs depending on the
 	availability of Tk; let that be the list of all PLUGIN
 	subdirectories present, as it used to be.  Instead, edit a new
 	variable, build_subdirs; write its final value, the list of
 	subdirs we do want to compile in, to config.build-subdirs.
  	Substitute that into the top-level Makefile too.
	* Makefile.in (subdirs): Set this to @build_subdirs@, so we only
	recurse on the subdirectories we should build.
	(distdirs): Set this to @existingdirs@, so it includes the subdirs
	we decided not to build.

	* doc/gtcltk.texi: File resurrected from old Guile releases.
	* doc/Makefile.in (info): Build the gtcltk documentation.
	(DIST_FILES): Include it in the distribution.

	* configure.in: If we can find the library for tcl7.5, build
 	gtcltk-lib.  Call AC_PROG_CC, to help run that test with the right
 	compiler (not sure this is necessary).

Mon Aug 12 15:09:37 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Fix bug reporting address.

Fri Aug  9 15:58:42 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* AUTHORS: New file, in accordance with the GNU maintainers'
 	standards.

Tue Aug  6 14:40:44 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* README: Renamed from ANNOUNCE; include bug report address,
	description, and short tour.
 	* INSTALL: Renamed from BUILDING.
	* NEWS: New file.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Update appropriately.

Thu Aug  1 02:31:53 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* doc/Makefile.in: Added pattern targets for creating DVI and
	PostScript files.
	(%.ps, %.dvi, %.txt): New targets.
	(DVIPS, TEXI2DVI): New variables.

	* GUILE-VERSION: Updated to 1.0b3.

	Rehashed distribution system, in preparation for nightly
	snapshots.  Other changes in subdirectories.
	* Makefile.in (dist): Rewritten --- the old target was out of
 	date, dependent on files that we don't have, and relied on GNU
 	tar.  The new target is simpler.
	(VERSION, srcdir, dist_dirs): New variables.
	(DISTFILES): Renamed from localfiles.  Added GUILE-VERSION and
	TODO.
	(localtreats): Variable removed.  We don't have this file.
	(info): cd to doc and make info there; don't make info in every
	${subdir}; those Makefiles don't know what to do.
	(distname, distdir, treats, announcefile): Variables removed.
	(manifest-file): Target removed.
	(dist-dir): New target, responsible for distributable files in
	this directory.
	(GZIP, GZIP_EXT, TAR_VERBOSE, DIST_NAME): New variables,
	controlling the 'dist' target.
	* configure.in: Substitute GUILE-VERSION into the top-level
	Makefile.  Build doc/Makefile from doc/Makefile.in.

	* doc/Makefile.in: New file.
