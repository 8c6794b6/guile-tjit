	OpenBSD.

Tue Jun  3 16:34:19 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	pretty much trust) if it is installed.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon May 26 12:14:20 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* COPYING: New address for FSF.

	* configure.in: We don't need to add fileblocks.o to LIBOBJS if
 	struct stat doesn't have the st_blocks field.  We take care of
 	that case in the code.  Replace AC_STRUCT_ST_BLOCKS with its
 	definition, edited appropriately.  (Bernard URBAN)
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sat May 17 13:49:28 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

Fri May 16 17:26:10 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	to sooth Anthony's enormous, but wounded, ego.

Fri May 16 17:26:53 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Just kidding!!!

Fri May 16 04:24:48 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Guile 1.1 released.
	* GUILE-VERSION: Bump to 1.1.

	Switch to automake-1.1p.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated.

	survive.

	* ltconfig, ltmain.sh, config.guess, config.sub: New versions,
	supplied by libtool.

	* configure.in: When configuring qt, sunos needs the underscore
	files; Solaris and Linux both need the normal files.

Thu May  1 15:35:49 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Get the paths for qt's md files right, so it can
 	build correctly when using a separate compilation directory.

Thu Apr 24 01:20:34 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	first.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.
	* aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerate, with modern definition of
 	CY_AC_WITH_THREADS.  Where did the old text come from?  Creepy...

	Reduced Guile distribution: one configure script, no plugins.
	* configure.in: Merged the old text from qt/configure.in and
	libguile/configure.in; Tom Tromey says automake only wants one
	configure.in script.  This seems fishy, but...
	* Makefile.am: List the subdirectories explicitly; no more PLUGIN
	gubbish.
	* acconfig.h, acinclude.m4: Moved here from libguile, since
	libguile's configure script lives here now.
	* AUTHORS, INSTALL, README: Updated.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4 configure: Regenerated.  Just like
	amputated amphibian limbs.

	need to link against libthreads; the files it used to contain
	are now a part of libguile.

Sun Apr 13 22:14:10 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* guile.m4: Revert change of Mar 15, and use the new 'no-define'

	* guile.m4 (AM_INIT_GUILE_MODULE): Replaced AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE macro
 	with its definition and commented out definition of PACKAGE.  This
 	changed seemed necessary after having removed PACKAGE from
 	libguile/acconfig.h.

	* ltconfig, ltmain.sh: New versions from libtool-0.9.

 	rx, gh and gtcltk-lib can now be build as shared libraries.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added ltconfig and ltmain.sh

Sun Jan  5 16:57:10 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): added mkinstalldirs to the DISTFILES

	configured/built.

Wed Sep 11 21:11:33 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* lgh/: added the directory in which I implement the high level

Thu Aug 15 19:03:03 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Check for -ldl, so the check for Tcl won't fail
 	spuriously.

Thu Aug 15 01:29:29 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Change the way we decide whether to build gtcltk-lib, so that it's
	omitted from the build process when appropriate, but never from
	the dist process.
	* configure.in: Don't edit all_subdirs depending on the
 	availability of Tk; let that be the list of all PLUGIN
 	subdirectories present, as it used to be.  Instead, edit a new
 	variable, build_subdirs; write its final value, the list of
 	subdirs we do want to compile in, to config.build-subdirs.
  	Substitute that into the top-level Makefile too.
	* Makefile.in (subdirs): Set this to @build_subdirs@, so we only
	recurse on the subdirectories we should build.
	(distdirs): Set this to @existingdirs@, so it includes the subdirs
	we decided not to build.

	* doc/gtcltk.texi: File resurrected from old Guile releases.
	* doc/Makefile.in (info): Build the gtcltk documentation.
	(DIST_FILES): Include it in the distribution.

	* configure.in: If we can find the library for tcl7.5, build
 	gtcltk-lib.  Call AC_PROG_CC, to help run that test with the right
 	compiler (not sure this is necessary).

Mon Aug 12 15:09:37 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Fix bug reporting address.

Fri Aug  9 15:58:42 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* AUTHORS: New file, in accordance with the GNU maintainers'
 	standards.

Tue Aug  6 14:40:44 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* GUILE-VERSION: Updated to 1.0b3.

	Rehashed distribution system, in preparation for nightly
	snapshots.  Other changes in subdirectories.
	* Makefile.in (dist): Rewritten --- the old target was out of
 	date, dependent on files that we don't have, and relied on GNU
 	tar.  The new target is simpler.
	(VERSION, srcdir, dist_dirs): New variables.
	(DISTFILES): Renamed from localfiles.  Added GUILE-VERSION and
	TODO.
	(localtreats): Variable removed.  We don't have this file.
	(info): cd to doc and make info there; don't make info in every
	${subdir}; those Makefiles don't know what to do.
	(distname, distdir, treats, announcefile): Variables removed.
	(manifest-file): Target removed.
	(dist-dir): New target, responsible for distributable files in
	this directory.
	(GZIP, GZIP_EXT, TAR_VERBOSE, DIST_NAME): New variables,
	controlling the 'dist' target.
	* configure.in: Substitute GUILE-VERSION into the top-level
	Makefile.  Build doc/Makefile from doc/Makefile.in.

	* doc/Makefile.in: New file.
