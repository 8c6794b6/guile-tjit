# Commentary:

# Usage: pre-inst-guile [ARGS]
#
# This script arranges for the environment to support, and eventaully execs,
# the uninstalled binary guile executable located somewhere under libguile/,
# passing ARGS to it.  In the process, env var GUILE is clobbered, and the
# following env vars are modified (but not clobbered):
#   GUILE_LOAD_PATH
#   LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH
#
# This script can be used as a drop-in replacement for $bindir/guile;
# if there is a discrepency in behavior, that's a bug.

# Code:

# config
subdirs_with_ltlibs="srfi guile-readline"       # maintain me

# env (set by configure)
top_srcdir="@top_srcdir@"
top_builddir="@top_builddir_absolute@"

  x"$top_builddir" = x -o ! -d "$top_builddir" ] && {
    echo $0: bad environment
    echo top_srcdir=$top_srcdir
    echo top_builddir=$top_builddir
    exit 1
}

# handle GUILE_LOAD_PATH (no clobber)
