;;; Commentary:

;; Usage: read-scheme-source FILE1 FILE2 ...
;;
;; This program parses each FILE and writes to stdout sexps that describe the
;; top-level structures of the file: scheme forms, single-line comments, and
;; hash-bang comments.  You can further process these (to associate comments
;; w/ scheme forms as a kind of documentation, for example).
;;
;; The output sexps have one of these forms:
;;
;;    (quote (filename FILENAME))
;;
;;    (quote (comment :leading-semicolons N
;;                    :text LINE))
;;
;;    (quote (whitespace :text LINE))
;;
;;    (quote (hash-bang-comment :line LINUM
;;                              :line-count N
;;                              :text-list (LINE1 LINE2 ...)))
;;
;;    (quote (following-form-properties :line LINUM
;;                                      :line-count N)
;;                                      :type TYPE
;;                                      :signature SIGNATURE
;;                                      :std-int-doc DOCSTRING))
;;
;;    SEXP
;;
;; The first four are straightforward (both FILENAME and LINE are strings sans
;; newline, while LINUM and N are integers).  The last two always go together,
;; in that order.  SEXP is scheme code processed only by `read' and then
;; `write'.
;;
;; The :type field may be omitted if the form is not recognized.  Otherwise,
;; TYPE may be one of: procedure, alias, define-module, variable.
;;
;; The :signature field may be omitted if the form is not a procedure.
;; Otherwise, SIGNATURE is a list showing the procedure's signature.
;;
;; If the type is `procedure' and the form has a standard internal docstring
;; (first body form a string), that is extracted in full -- including any
;; embedded newlines -- and recorded by field :std-int-doc.
;;
;;
;; Usage from a program: The output list of sexps can be retrieved by scheme
;; programs w/o having to capture stdout, like so:
;;
;;    (use-modules (scripts read-scheme-source))
;;    (define source-forms (read-scheme-source-silently "FILE1" "FILE2" ...))
;;
;;
;; TODO: Add option "--clump-comments", maybe w/ different clumping styles.
;;       Make `annotate!' extensible.
