The Guile core distribution:

I (Jim Blandy) made the Guile 1.3.2 release in a bit of a rush, and
then skipped town for a week.  There were some problems, but Mikael
Djurfeldt did a fantastic job of fixing my mistakes and putting
together a new release file.  I'm very grateful to Mikael for this;
Guile is very lucky to have him.
