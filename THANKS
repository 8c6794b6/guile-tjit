The Guile core distribution:

The Guile maintainer is Jim ("Miserable old dodderer") Blandy.

Thanks to:
- Mikael ("Lazy dog") Djurfeldt, for his work on GOOPS, last-minute
  fixes to the 1.3.2 release, and just generally being really energetic
  and helpful.
- Chris Hanson, for writing the debugger
- Gary Houston, for continuing work on the I/O system.
- Tom Tromey, for Automake therapy (the code and its users alike).
- Greg Harvey, for work on the Guile web pages.
- Marius Vollmer, for extensive kibbitzing, and keeping Mikael company.
