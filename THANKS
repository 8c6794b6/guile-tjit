The Guile core distribution:

Mikael Djurfeldt contributed core support for GOOPS, a CLOS-like object
    system for Guile, a generalized set! syntax, and a new random number
    generator.
Greg Badros contributes patches to use the new SMOB interface.
Gary Houston contributed a more efficient and portable implementation of
    I/O ports, and hacked on (ice-9 expect).
Michael Livshin implemented Dybvig's Guardians.
Roland Orre contributed list and vector sorting functions.
Russ McManus contributed a command-line argument parser (ice-9 getopt-long).
Ken Raeburn contributed patches to make Guile use `const' in some
    appropriate places.
Greg Harvey made sure I didn't lose any patches, and made readline
    highlight matching parenthesis.
