The Guile core distribution:

Thanks to:
- Mikael Djurfeldt, for his work on GOOPS, last-minute fixes to the
  1.3.2 release, and just generally being really energetic and helpful.
- Gary Houston, for continuing work on the I/O system.
- Tom Tromey, for Automake therapy (the code and its users alike).
- Greg Harvey, for work on the Guile web pages.
- Marius Vollmer, for kibbitzing, and keeping Mikael company.
