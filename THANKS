The Guile core distribution:

I (Jim Blandy) made the Guile 1.3.2 release in a bit of a rush, and
then skipped town for a week.  Mikael Djurfeldt did a fantastic job of
fixing my mistakes and putting together a new release file.  I'm very
grateful to Mikael for this; Guile is very lucky to have him.
