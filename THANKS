The Guile core distribution:

Mikael Djurfeldt contributed core support for GOOPS, a CLOS-like object
    system for Guile.
Gary Houston contributed a more efficient and portable implementation of
    I/O ports, and hacked on (ice-9 expect).
Michael Livshin implemented Dybvig's Guardians.
Russ McManus contributed a command-line argument parser (ice-9 getopt-long).
Ken Raeburn made Guile use `const' in some appropriate places.
Greg Harvey made sure I didn't lose any patches, and made readline
    highlight matching parenthesis.
