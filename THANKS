The Guile core distribution:

Gary Houston contributed a new, more efficient implementation of I/O ports,
    and hacked on (ice-9 expect).
Michael Livshin implemented Dybvig's Guardians.
Russ McManus contributed a command-line argument parser (ice-9 getopt-long).
Ken Raeburn made Guile use `const' in some appropriate places.
Greg Harvey made readline highlight matching parenthesis.
