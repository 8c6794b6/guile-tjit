This is beta release 1.0b3 of Guile, the GNU extension language library.
Please send bug reports to bug-guile@prep.ai.mit.edu.

Guile is a portable, embeddable Scheme implementation written in C.
Guile provides a machine independent execution platform that can be
linked in as a library when building extensible programs.

Guile is derived from SCM, by Aubrey Jaffer and others.  Tom Lord
librarified SCM, yielding Guile.  He wrote Guile's operating system,
Ice-9, connected Guile to Tcl/Tk and the `rx' regular expression
matcher, and took care of a lot of miscellany.

Interesting files include:
- INSTALL, which contains instructions on building and installing Guile.
- NEWS, which describes user-visible changes since the last release of Guile.
- COPYING, which describes the terms under which you may redistribute
  Guile, and explains that there is no warranty.

The Guile source tree is laid out as follows:

doc:	  Documentation for Guile, in Texinfo form.
libguile: The Guile Scheme interpreter, packaged as an object
          library for you to link with your programs.
guile:    An interactive front end for the Guile Scheme interpreter.
rx:       A regular expression matching library, interfaced to Guile.
ice-9:    Guile's module system, initialization code, and other infrastructure.
