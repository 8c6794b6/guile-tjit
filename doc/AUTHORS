The Guile reference and tutorial manuals were written and edited
largely by Mark Galassi and Jim Blandy.  Significant portions were
contributed by Gary Houston and Tim Pierce.

Tom Lord contributed a great deal of material with early Guile
snapshots; although most of this text has been rewritten, all of it
was important, and much of the structure remains.

Aubrey Jaffer wrote the SCM Scheme implementation and manual upon
which the Guile program and manual are based.  Some portions of the
SCM and SLIB manuals have been included here verbatim.
