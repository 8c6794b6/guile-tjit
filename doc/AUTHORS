@c authorship information in more than one place.

@ifset guile

@c The Guile reference and tutorial manuals were written and edited
@c largely by Mark Galassi and Jim Blandy.  In particular, Jim wrote the
@c original tutorial on Guile's data representation and the C API for
@c accessing Guile objects.

@c Significant portions were contributed by Gary Houston (contributions
@c to posix system calls and networking, expect, I/O internals and
@c extensions, slib installation, error handling) and Tim Pierce
@c (sections on script interpreter triggers, alists, function tracing).

@c Tom Lord contributed a great deal of material with early Guile
@c snapshots; although most of this text has been rewritten, all of it
@c was important, and much of the structure remains.

@c Aubrey Jaffer wrote the SCM Scheme implementation and manual upon
@c which the Guile program and manual are based.  Some portions of the
@c SCM and SLIB manuals have been included here verbatim.

@c Since Guile 1.4, Neil Jerram has been maintaining and improving the
@c reference manual.  Among other contributions, he wrote the Basic
@c Ideas chapter, developed the tools for keeping the manual in sync
@c with snarfed libguile docstrings, and reorganized the structure so as
@c to accommodate docstrings for all Guile's primitives.
