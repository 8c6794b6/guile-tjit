README for guile-core/doc/maint                      -*- text -*-

The files in this directory are used by the maintainers to automate
the process of updating the Guile reference manual when the docstrings
in the libguile C source change.

- ChangeLog is the change log for files in this directory.

- README is this file.

- docstring.el is a helpful Emacs Lisp library.  The two key entry
  points are `docstring-process-module' and
  `docstring-ediff-this-line'.

- guile.texi is a snapshot of the built file
  guile-core/libguile/guile.texi, copied last time the reference
  manual was determined to be in sync with the libguile source.
