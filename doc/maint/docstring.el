;;; Commentary:

;; The basic premise of these utilities is that - at least in the
;; short term - we can get a lot of reference manual mileage by
;; co-opting the docstrings that are snarfed automatically from
;; Guile's C and Scheme source code.  But this leads to problems of
;; synchronization...  How do you track when a docstring has been
;; updated in the source and so needs updating in the reference
;; manual.  What if a procedure is removed from the Guile source?  And
;; so on.  To complicate matters, the exact snarfed docstring text
;; will probably need to be modified so that it fits into the flow of
;; the manual section in which it appears.  Can we design solutions to
;; synchronization problems that continue to work even when the manual
;; text has been enhanced in this way?
;;
;; This file implements an approach to this problem that I have found
;; useful.  It involves keeping track of three copies of each
;; docstring:
;;
;; "MANUAL"   = the docstring as it appears in the reference manual.
;;
;; "SNARFED"  = the docstring as snarfed from the current C or Scheme
;;              source.
;;
;; "TRACKING" = the docstring as it appears in a tracking file whose
;;              purpose is to record the most recent snarfed docstrings
;;              that are known to be in sync with the reference manual.
;;
;; The approaches are as follows.
;;
;; 1. Comparison of MANUAL-DOC, SOURCE-DOC and TRACK-DOC, to produce a
;;    summary output buffer in which keystrokes are defined to bring up
;;    detailed comparisons.
;;
;; 2. Comparison of MANUAL-DOC, SOURCE-DOC and TRACK-DOC using Ediff.
;;
;; Here is a brief list of commands available (via "M-x COMMAND"):
;;
;;    docstring-process-current-buffer
;;    docstring-process-current-region BEG END
;;    docstring-process-module MODULE
;;    docstring-ediff-this-line
