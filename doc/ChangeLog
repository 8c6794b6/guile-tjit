	* .cvsignore: New file, containing data-rep.info.  I'm not sure
 	whether we want to check this file into CVS, because it's
 	generated; if you find compelling reasons it should be, let me
	know.

	* New directory for documentation.
	* README: New file.

 	mdate-sh, stamp-vti, texinfo.tex, version.texi: The usual support
 	files.
