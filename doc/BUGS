Known Guile documentation bugs                -*- outline -*-

* The building of HTML docs is dependent on GNU Make

This is because the Makefile.am's for the Guile reference manual and
tutorial use a $(shell ...) command to list the set of HTML files to
install.

Probably this will not be fixed until Automake gains proper HTML doc
support.  On the other hand, if we've overlooked a more
version-independent way of achieving the same thing, please let us
know.
