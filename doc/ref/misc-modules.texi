@cindex pretty printing
The module @code{(ice-9 pretty-print)} provides the procedure
@code{pretty-print}, which provides nicely formatted output of Scheme
objects.  This is especially useful for deeply nested or complex data
structures, such as lists and vectors.

The module is loaded by simply saying.

@lisp
(use-modules (ice-9 pretty-print))
@end lisp

This makes the procedure @code{pretty-print} available.  As an example
how @code{pretty-print} will format the output, see the following:

@lisp
(pretty-print '(define (foo) (lambda (x)
(cond ((zero? x) #t) ((negative? x) -x) (else (if (= x 1) 2 (* x x x)))))))
@print{}
(define (foo)
  (lambda (x)
    (cond ((zero? x) #t)
          ((negative? x) -x)
          (else (if (= x 1) 2 (* x x x))))))
@end lisp

@deffn procedure pretty-print obj [port]
Print the textual representation of the Scheme object @var{obj} to
@var{port}.  @var{port} defaults to the current output port, if not
given.
@end deffn

Beware: Since @code{pretty-print} uses it's own write procedure, it's
output will not be the same as for example the output of @code{write}.
Consider the following example.

@lisp
(write (lambda (x) x))
@print{}
#<procedure #f (x)>

(pretty-print (lambda (x) x))
@print{}
#[procedure]
@end lisp

The reason is that @code{pretty-print} does not know as much about
Guile's object types as the builtin procedures.  This is particularly
important for smobs, for which a write procedure can be defined and be
used by @code{write}, but not by @code{pretty-print}.

@c FIXME::martin: Review me!

@cindex format
@cindex formatted output
Outputting messages or other texts which are composed of literal
strings, variable contents, newlines and other formatting can be
cumbersome, when only the standard procedures like @code{display},
@code{write} and @code{newline} are available.  Additionally, one
often wants to collect the output in strings.  With the standard
routines, the user is required to set up a string port, add this port
as a parameter to the output procedure calls and then retrieve the
resulting string from the string port.

The @code{format} procedure, to be found in module @code{(ice-9
format)}, can do all this, and even more.  If you are a C programmer,
you can think of this procedure as Guile's @code{fprintf}.

@deffn procedure format destination format-string args @dots{}
The first parameter is the @var{destination}, it determines where the
output of @code{format} will go.

@table @asis
@item @code{#t}
Send the formatted output to the current output port and return
@code{#t}.

@item @code{#f}
Return the formatted output as a string.

@item Any number value
Send the formatted output to the current error port and return
@code{#t}.

@item A valid output port
Send the formatted output to the port @var{destination} and return
@code{#t}.
@end table

The second parameter is the format string.  It has a similar function
to the format string in calls to @code{printf} or @code{fprintf} in C.
It is output to the specified destination, but all escape sequences
are replaced by the results of formatting the corresponding sequence.

Note that escape sequences are marked with the character @code{~}
(tilde), and not with a @code{%} (percent sign), as in C.

The escape sequences in the following table are supported.  When there
appears ``corresponding @var{arg}', that means any of the additional
arguments, after dropping all arguments which have been used up by
escape sequences which have been processed earlier.  Some of the
format characters (the characters following the tilde) can be prefixed
by @code{:}, @code{@@}, or @code{:@@}, to modify the behaviour of the
format character.  How the modified behaviour differs from the default
behaviour is described for every character in the table where
appropriate.

@table @code
@item ~~
Output a single @code{~} (tilde) character.

@item ~%
Output a newline character, thus advancing to the next output line.

@item ~&
Start a new line, that is, output a newline character if not already
at the statr of a line.

@item ~_
Output a single space character.

@item ~/
Output a single tabulator character.

@item ~|
Output a page separator (formfeed) character.

@item ~t
Advance to the next tabulator position.

@item ~y
Pretty-print the correspinding @var{arg}.

@item ~a
Output the corresponding @var{arg} like @code{display}.

@item ~s
Output the corresponding @var{arg} like @code{write}.

@item ~d
Output the corresponding @var{arg} as a decimal number.

@item ~x
Output the corresponding @var{arg} as a hexadecimal number.

@item ~o
Output the corresponding @var{arg} as an octal number.

@item ~b
Output the corresponding @var{arg} as a binary number.

@item ~r
Output the corresponding @var{arg} as a number word, e.g. 10 prints as
@code{ten}.  If prefixed with @code{:}, @code{tenth} is printed, if
prefixed with @code{:@@}, roman numbers are printed.

@item ~f
Output the corresponding @var{arg} as a fixed format floating point
number, such as @code{1.34}.

@item ~e
Output the corresponding @var{arg} in exponential notation, such as
@code{1.34E+0}.

@item ~g
%% FIXME::martin: There must be a difference.  Does anybody know?
Like @code{~f}.  

@item ~$
Like @code{~f}, but only with two digits after the decimal point.

@item ~i
Output the corresponding @var{arg} as a complex number.

@item ~c
Output the corresponding @var{arg} as a character.  If prefixed with
@code{@@}, it is printed like with @code{write}.  If prefixed with
@code{:}, control characters are treated specially, for example
@code{#\newline} will be printed as @code{^J}.

@item ~p
``Plural''.  If the corresponding @var{arg} is 1, nothing is printed
(or @code{y} if prefixed with @code{@@} or @code{:@@}), otherwise
@code{s} is printed (or @code{ies} if prefixed with @code{@@} or
@code{:@@}).

@item ~?, ~k
Take the corresponding argument as a format string, and the following
argument as a list of values.  Then format the values with respect to
the format string.

@item ~!
Flush the output to the output port.

@item ~#\newline (tilde-newline)
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Continuation lines.

@item ~*
Argument jumping. Navigate in the argument list as specified by the
corresponding argument.  If prefixed with @code{:}, jump backwards in
the argument list, if prefixed by @code{:@@}, jump to the parameter
with the absolute index, otherwise jump forward in the argument list.

@item ~(
Case conversion begin.  If prefixed by @code{:}, the following output
string will be capitalized, if prefixed by @code{@@}, the first
character will be capitalized, if prefixed by @code{:@@} it will be
upcased and otherwise it will be downcased.  Conversion stops when the
``Case conversion end'' @code{~)}sequence is encountered.

@item ~)
Case conversion end.  Stop any case conversion currently in effect.

@item ~[
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Conditional begin.

@item ~;
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Conditional separator.

@item ~]
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Conditional end.

@item ~@{
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Iteration begin.

@item ~@}
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Iteration end.

@item ~^
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Up and out.

@item ~'
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Character parameter.

@item ~0 @dots{} ~9, ~-, ~+
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Numeric parameter.

@item ~v
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Variable parameter from next argument.

@item ~#
Parameter is number of remaining args.  The number of the remaining
arguments is prepended to the list of unprocessed arguments.

@item ~,
@c FIXME::martin: I don't understand this from the source.
Parameter separators.

@item ~q
Inquiry message.  Insert a copyright message into the output.
@end table

If any type conversions should fail (for example when using an escape
sequence for number output, but the argument is a string), an error
will be signalled.
@end deffn

You may have noticed that Guile contains a @code{format} procedure
even when the module @code{(ice-9 format)} is not loaded.  The default
@code{format} procedure does not support all escape sequences
documented in this chapter, and will signal an error if you try to use
one of them.  The reason for providing two versions of @code{format}
is that the full-featured module is fairly large and requires some
time to get loaded.  So the Guile maintainers decided not to load the
large version of @code{format} by default, so that the start-up time
of the interpreter is not unnecessarily increased.
