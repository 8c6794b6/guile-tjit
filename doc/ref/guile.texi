@c Notes
@c
@c We no longer use the category "primitive" to distinguish C-defined
@c Scheme procedures from those defined in Scheme.  Instead, the
@c reference manual now includes a C declaration as well as a Scheme
@c declaration for each procedure that is available in both Scheme and
@c C.
@c
@c When adding a new reference entry to the Guile manual, please
@c document it with @deffn using one of the following categories:
@c
@c   {Scheme Procedure}
@c   {Scheme Syntax}
@c   {C Function}
@c   {C Macro}
@c
@c If the entry is for a new primitive, it should have both a @deffn
@c {Scheme Procedure} line and a @deffnx {C Function} line; see the
@c manual source for plenty of existing examples of this.
@c
@c For {C Function} entries where the return type and all parameter
@c types are SCM, we omit the SCMs.  This is easier to read and also
@c gets round the problem that Texinfo doesn't allow a @deftypefnx
@c inside a @deffn.
@c
@c For a list of Guile primitives that are not yet incorporated into the
@c reference manual, see the file `new-docstrings.texi', which holds all
@c the docstrings snarfed from the libguile C sources for primitives
@c that are not in the reference manual.  If you have worked with some
@c of these concepts, implemented them, or just happen to know what they
@c do, please write up a little explanation -- it would be a big help.
@c Alternatively, if you know of any reason why some of these should
@c *not* go in the manual, please let the mailing list
@c <guile-devel@gnu.org> know.

@c Define indices that are used in the Guile Scheme part of the
@c reference manual to group stuff according to whether it is R5RS or a
@c Guile extension.
@defcodeindex rn

@c vnew - For (some) new items, indicates the Guile version in which
@c item first appeared.  In future, this could be made to expand to
@c something like a "New in Guile 45!" banner.
@macro vnew{VERSION}
@end macro

@c  @m{T,N} is $T$ in tex or @math{N} otherwise.  This is an easy way to give
@c  different forms for math in tex and info.
@iftex
@macro m {T,N}

@c AUTHORS

@c The Guile reference and tutorial manuals were written and edited
@c largely by Mark Galassi and Jim Blandy.  In particular, Jim wrote the
@c original tutorial on Guile's data representation and the C API for
@c accessing Guile objects.

@c Significant portions were contributed by Gary Houston (contributions
@c to POSIX system calls and networking, expect, I/O internals and
@c extensions, slib installation, error handling) and Tim Pierce
@c (sections on script interpreter triggers, alists, function tracing).

@c Tom Lord contributed a great deal of material with early Guile
@c snapshots; although most of this text has been rewritten, all of it
@c was important, and some of the structure remains.

@c Aubrey Jaffer wrote the SCM Scheme implementation and manual upon
@c which the Guile program and manual are based.  Some portions of the
@c SCM and SLIB manuals have been included here verbatim.

@c Since Guile 1.4, Neil Jerram has been maintaining and improving the
@c reference manual.  Among other contributions, he wrote the Basic
@c Ideas chapter, developed the tools for keeping the manual in sync
@c with snarfed libguile docstrings, and reorganized the structure so as
@c to accommodate docstrings for all Guile's primitives.

@c Martin Grabmueller has made substantial contributions throughout the
@c reference manual in preparation for the Guile 1.6 release, including
@c filling out a lot of the documentation of Scheme data types, control
@c mechanisms and procedures.  In addition, he wrote the documentation
@c for Guile's SRFI modules and modules associated with the Guile REPL.

@unnumbered Part II: Writing and Running Guile Scheme

Guile's core language is Scheme, and an awful lot can be achieved simply
by using Guile to write and run Scheme programs.  In this part of the
manual, we explain how to use Guile in this mode, and describe the tools
that Guile provides to help you with script writing, debugging and
packaging your programs for distribution.

For readers who are not yet familiar with the Scheme language, this part
includes a chapter that presents the basic concepts of the language, and
gives references to freely available Scheme tutorial material on the
web.

For detailed reference information on the variables, functions etc. that
make up Guile's application programming interface (API), please refer to
Part IV (@pxref{Reference Intro,,Part IV --- Guile API Reference}).

@unnumbered Part III: Guile as an Extension Language

In this part of the manual, we aim to present a wide ranging picture of
what it means to use Guile as an application extension language, to
provide guidance, practical guidelines and tips for @emph{how} to
program in Guile, and to document the tools that are available to help
you with your programming.  For detailed reference information on the
variables, functions etc. that make up Guile's application programming

@unnumbered Part IV: Guile API Reference

Guile provides an application programming interface (@dfn{API}) to
developers in two core languages: Scheme and C.  This part of the manual
contains reference documentation for all of the functionality that is
available through both Scheme and C interfaces.
