2001-11-04  Neil Jerram  <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>

	* preface.texi: Use MANUAL_EDITION variable.
	(Manual Layout): Updated to reflect reorg.

	* guile.texi (MANUAL_EDITION): New variable, with value
	incremented from 1.0 to 1.1 to reflect the reorg described here.
	(Top): Use MANUAL_EDITION variable.

	* scheme-indices.texi (R5RS Index, Guile Extensions Index): Use
	@unnumbered rather than @chapter for these indices.

	* guile.texi (Top): A little top-level reshuffling, with the aims
	that: (1) the `Guile Scheme' (reference) part of the manual
	becomes the `Guile API Reference', and covers both Scheme and C
	interfaces; (2) non-API-reference material such as the `Basic
	Ideas in Scheme' chapter is collected together to form a new part
	`Programming with Guile'.  This new part will contain general
	documentation on using and programming Guile in both Scheme and C,
	including - for example - awareness of GC when C programming, how
	to use the snarf macros, how to debug ...
	(Top): Move inclusion of scheme-indices.texi so that all indices
	appear together in the printed manual.

	* Makefile.am (guile_TEXINFOS): Removed appendices.texi, added
	debugging.texi.
	
	* appendices.texi: Removed.

	* debugging.texi (Debugger User Interface): New file, same as the
	material that used to be in appendices.texi, but now a chapter in
	Part II rather than an appendix.

	* appendices.texi (Obtaining and Installing Guile): Moved to
	become a chapter in ...
	* intro.texi: ... Part I: Introduction to Guile.

	* scm.texi (I/O Extensions): Moved to become a section of ...
	* scheme-io.texi (Input and Output): ... this chapter.

	* scm.texi (Handling Errors): Moved to become a section of ...
	* scheme-control.texi (Control Mechanisms): ... this chapter.

	procedures, SRFI-19 Date object and accessors, SRFI-19

	* guile.texi, scsh.texi: removed obsolete guile-scsh material

	The change log for files in this directory continues backwards
	from 2001-08-27 in ../ChangeLog, as all the Guile documentation
	prior to this date was contained in a single directory.
