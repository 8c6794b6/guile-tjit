This directory contains documentation on the Guile core.

At the moment, we don't have a full manual on Guile; that's at the
head of our task list.  You can see a snapshot of the new Guile
reference manual by checking out the `guile-doc' CVS module.

The file `oldfmt.c' contains a function which can be used by
application writers to support both old-style and new-style error
format strings.

The file `data-rep.texi', which used to be in this directory, is now
integrated into the Guile reference manual: the integrated version of
this essay is the `Data Representation' chapter.  (This chapter is an
essay on how to write C code that uses Guile values.  If you're
interested in writing a application which is extensible via Guile,
this is a good place to start.)  To update the Texinfo source for this
essay - for example, when the smob interface changes - please update
the file `guile-doc/ref/data-rep.texi' in the guile-doc module.
