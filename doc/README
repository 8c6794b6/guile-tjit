This directory contains documentation on the Guile core.

At the moment, we don't have a full manual on Guile; that's at the
head of our task list.

The file `data-rep.texi' is an essay on how to write C code that uses
Guile values.  If you're interested in writing a application which is
extensible via Guile, this is a good place to start.  Make builds the
`info' manual by default, designed to be read on-line; if you want to
print it out, go to the `doc' subdirectory of the tree you're building
in, and run `make data-rep.ps'.
