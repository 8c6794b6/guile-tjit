This directory contains documentation on the Guile core.         -*-text-*-

The documentation consists of the following manuals.

- The Guile Tutorial (guile-tut.texi) contains a tutorial introduction
  to using Guile.

- The Guile Reference Manual (guile.texi) contains (or is intended to
  contain) reference documentation on all aspects of Guile.

- The GOOPS Manual (goops.texi) contains both tutorial-style and
  reference documentation for using GOOPS, Guile's Object Oriented
  Programming System.

- The Revised^4 and Revised^5 Reports on the Algorithmic Language
  Scheme (r4rs.texi and r5rs.texi).

Please be aware that this is all very much work in progress (apart
from the Revised Reports).  Bug reports and contributions are
welcome!

The file `oldfmt.c' contains a function which can be used by
application writers to support both old-style and new-style error
format strings.

The `sources' directory includes some stuff relevant to the Guile
reference manual, and which may eventually be folded in to it.  It's
not immediately relevant, however, which is why it's not in this
directory.
