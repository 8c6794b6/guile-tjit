Guile-VM NEWS


Guile-VM is a bytecode compiler and virtual machine for Guile.


guile-vm 0.7 -- 2008-05-20
==========================

* Initial release with NEWS.

* Revived from Keisuke Nishida's Guile-VM project from 2000-2001, with
  the help of Ludovic CourtÃ¨s.

* Meta-level changes
** Updated to compile with Guile 1.8.
** Documentation updated, including documentation on the instructions.
** Added benchmarking and a test harness.

* Changes to the inventory
** Renamed the library from libguilevm to libguile-vm.
** Added new executable script, guile-disasm.

* New features
** Add support for compiling macros, both defmacros and syncase macros.
Primitive macros produced with the procedure->macro family of procedures
are not supported, however.
** Improvements to the REPL
Multiple values support, readline integration, ice-9 history integration
** Add support for eval-case
The compiler recognizes compile-toplevel in addition to load-toplevel
** Completely self-compiling
Almost, anyway: not (system repl describe), because it uses GOOPS

* Internal cleanups
** Internal objects are now based on Guile records.
** Guile-VM's code doesn't use the dot-syntax any more.
** Changed (ice-9 match) for Kiselyov's pmatch.scm
** New instructions: define, link-later, link-now, late-variable-{ref,set}
** Object code now represented as u8vectors instead of strings.
** Remove local import of an old version of slib

* Bugfixes
** The `optimize' procedure is coming out of bitrot
** The Scheme compiler is now more strict about placement of internal
   defines
** set! is now compiled differently from define
** Module-level variables are now bound at first use instead of in the
   program prolog
** Bugfix to load-program (stack misinterpretation)
