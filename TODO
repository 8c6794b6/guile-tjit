-*-text-*-

These TODO items are grouped by target release version.  The first group is
the "Eventually" group, which is not associated w/ any particular version.
Move these items under a version upon completion (or better yet, ownership).

Upon completion, simply change the "-" to a "+", but do not delete the item.
At release time, the "+" entries will be deleted after review to make sure
that user-visible changes are reflected in NEWS (and that proper credit is
applied :-).

Ownership is indicated by `[USERNAME]'.  Maintainers (w/ write privs) can
indicate sponsorship by `[ACTUAL-OWNER:MAINTAINER]', where both elements are
usernames.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Eventually:

- [after signal handling and threading have been fixed] remove the code
  corresponding to GUILE_OLD_ASYNC_CLICK and the corresponding
  GUILE_OLD_ASYNC_CLICK macro.
- implement and integrate generational garbage collection
- add POSIX thread support
- factor thread support out of libguile
- protect common resources using mutecis from the new interface
- remove the dynamic roots
- revise the fluid implementation
- implement the GC thread synchronization (all threads: go to sleep!)
- implementing the libguileposix threads glue library
- GOOPS
  - develop better representation for GOOPS objects
  - rewrite method cache management in C
  - rewrite core macros (define-class et al) in C
  - define C API
- write Orbit CORBA interface
- [after new module system] factor out modules sort.c and random.c should be
  factored out into separate modules
- include malloc debugging code in an optional file in libguile
- fix looking up procedure names in environment in backtraces
- implement srcprops using double cells
- use "real" procprops
- add facilities for easily debugging Scheme programs from Emacs
- write good interface to Tk
- write translators for additional languages
  - Perl
  - Python
  - TCL
  - Emacs Lisp
  - Rexx
- make GDB work with Guile
- use the SCM trick of tagging environments with immediates (see m_letrec1)
  to convert source correctly in unmemocopy
- eliminate argument checking for closures
- Implement a thread-safe alternative to SCM's environment caches
- rename ice-9 to something more obvious
- implement implicitly shared substrings (thread-safe, copy on write).  In
  this context, the concept of read-only-strings might be re-introduced to
  implement the symbol->string semantics of R5RS.
- implement internationalized strings
- revise the uniform vector implementation

=== Before releasing 1.8.0:

- Make sure we have appropriate interface numbers for shared
  libraries, and that we document and use the libtool
  conventions. [rlb].

- Update the version numbers in GUILE-VERSION and README. [rlb]

- Start a new section of the NEWS file.

- Start a new THANKS file.

=== Before releasing 1.10.0:

- in boot-9.scm:
  remove deprecated function `feature?´.

[TODO ends here]
