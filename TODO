* Add facilities for debugging Scheme programs.

The low-level debugging support is done, and we are now working on the
user interface.

* Documentation.

We have a new layout for the reference manual which covers the
C/Scheme interface, as well as the scheme variants.  We also want a
more thorough tutorial manual, but we haven't sketched that out yet.


Desired later on

* Good interface to Tk and Gtk

* Add a convenient facility for running a pipeline of processes
with redirections.  Gary Houston <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>
is working on this.

* Make it possible to link Guile and TK without using libtcl.a, by
providing Guile-based replacements for the libtcl.a functions that TK
requires.

* Make ordinary lambda functions work as callbacks for Tk;
eliminate the need for tcl-lambda.

* Translators for additional languages; in particular, Perl, Python,
TCL, Emacs Lisp, and Rexx.

* Clean up declarations of C functions to use a PROTO macro
for conditional prototypes, instead of explicit conditionals.

* A package for time conversions and formatting.

* Make GDB work with Guile

This would permit programmable debugging and a nice integrated GUI.
