Needed before release

* Add facilities for debugging Scheme programs.

Mikael Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se> is working on this.

* Merge in the Cygnus threads package.

Anthony Green <green@cygnus.com> is working on this,
but he lacks time, so perhaps he could use help.


Desired later on

* Add a convenient facility for running a pipeline of processes
with redirections.  Gary Houston <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>
is working on this.

* Make it possible to link Guile and TK without using libtcl.a, by
providing Guile-based replacements for the libtcl.a functions that TK
requires.

* Make ordinary lambda functions work as callbacks for Tk;
eliminate the need for tcl-lambda.

* Translators for additional languages; in particular, Perl, Python,
TCL, Emacs Lisp, and Rexx.

* Clean up declarations of C functions to use a PROTO macro
for conditional prototypes, instead of explicit conditionals.

* A package for time conversions and formatting.
