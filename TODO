Needed before release

* Add facilities for debugging Scheme programs.

Mikael Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se> is working on this.  The low-level
functions are available, but need a user interface.  He has also
written extensisons to GDB to allow it to print lispy values in lispy
notation when debugging Guile's C code.

* Merge in the Cygnus threads package.

This is done, but needs debugging.

* Documentation.

They should be complete and accurate.  They should also have more
general explanation (right now they're strictly reference), but
perhaps that will have to wait until after the first release.


Desired later on

* Good interface to Tk

* Add a convenient facility for running a pipeline of processes
with redirections.  Gary Houston <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>
is working on this.

* Make it possible to link Guile and TK without using libtcl.a, by
providing Guile-based replacements for the libtcl.a functions that TK
requires.

* Make ordinary lambda functions work as callbacks for Tk;
eliminate the need for tcl-lambda.

* Translators for additional languages; in particular, Perl, Python,
TCL, Emacs Lisp, and Rexx.

* Clean up declarations of C functions to use a PROTO macro
for conditional prototypes, instead of explicit conditionals.

* A package for time conversions and formatting.
