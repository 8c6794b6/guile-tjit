	* tests/r4rs.test (SECTION 3 4): Each element of type-matrix
	corresponds to an example object, not a predicate.  Aubrey
	probably never noticed this because SCM doesn't check the lengths
	of the arguments to for-each and map...

	get EOF on the port --- don't just read forever.

	* lib.scm (full-reporter): The test name is the cadr of the
	result, not the cdr.  I'm not macho enough to handle run-time
	typechecking.

	* lib.scm (print-counts): XFAILS are "expected failures", not
	"unexpected failures."

	* lib.scm, guile-test, paths.scm: Log begins.
