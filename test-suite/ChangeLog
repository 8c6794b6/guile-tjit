Sun Jan 16 14:01:51 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* paths.scm: Assume that ~/guile-core/test-suite is the location
	of the test suite now.

	* tests/version.test: Added -- version.c had 0% coverage before,
	now at 100%.

	* tests/chars.test: Added -- needed test of char-is-both?.

1999-12-22  Greg Harvey <Greg.Harvey@thezone.net>

	* tests/weaks.test, tests/hooks.test: Added.

1999-12-18  Greg Harvey <Greg.Harvey@thezone.net>

	* tests/alist.test: Added.

Fri Dec 17 12:14:10 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/c-api.test: Refine the list of files that are checked in
	the seek-offset-test.  Was just using files that end in "c", but
	that caught the new ".doc" files, too, so make sure that files end 
	in ".c" before requiring that they include unistd.h if they
	reference SEEK_(SET|CUR|END).

1999-10-24  Gary Houston  <ghouston@freewire.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test ("string ports"): test seeking/unreading from
	an input string and seeking an output string.

1999-10-20  Gary Houston  <ghouston@freewire.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: in seek/tell test on input port, also test
	that ftell doesn't discard unread chars.

1999-10-18  Gary Houston  <ghouston@freewire.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: add seek/tell tests for unidirectional ports.

1999-09-25  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/reader.test: Check that number->string checks its radix
	properly.
	
1999-09-20  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test: Check that our input functions cope when
	current-input-port is closed.

	* tests/regexp.test: Check regexp-substitute/global when there are
	no matches.  (Duh.)

1999-09-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* tests/c-api.test: New file.  Add test to check that all source
	files which use SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END include unistd.h.

1999-09-14  Gary Houston  <ghouston@freewire.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: test non-blocking I/O.

1999-09-11  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/strings.test: Add test for substring-move! argument checking.

	* lib.scm (signals-error?, signals-error?*): New macro and function.
	* tests/reader.test: Use them.

	* tests/interp.test: Add copyright notice.

	* tests/reader.test: New test file.

	* tests/regexp.test: New test file.

1999-09-06  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* tests/interp.test: Added tests for evaluation of closure bodies.

1999-09-03  James Blandy  <jimb@mule.m17n.org>

	* tests/multilingual.nottest: New file, which we will turn into a
	test file once we actually have multilingual support to test.

	* tests/load.test: New test file.

1999-08-30  James Blandy  <jimb@mule.m17n.org>

	* tests/strings.test: New test file.

1999-08-29  Gary Houston  <ghouston@easynet.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: test unread-char and unread-string.

1999-08-19  Gary Houston  <ghouston@easynet.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: test line-buffering of fports.

1999-08-18  Gary Houston  <ghouston@easynet.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: tests for NUL and non-ASCII chars to fports.

1999-08-12  Gary Houston  <ghouston@easynet.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: lseek -> seek.

1999-08-04  Gary Houston  <ghouston@easynet.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: tests for buffered and unbuffered input/output
	fports with seeking.

1999-08-01  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/r4rs.test (SECTION 3 4): Each element of type-matrix
	corresponds to an example object, not a predicate.  Aubrey
	probably never noticed this because SCM doesn't check the lengths
	of the arguments to for-each and map...

	* tests/ports.test: Add some regression tests for char-ready?.

1999-07-19  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test: Fix copyright years.

	* tests/guardians.test: New test file.

	* tests/ports.test ("read-delimited!"): New tests.

1999-06-19  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/interp.test: New file.

1999-06-15  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/time.test: New test file.

	* tests/r4rs.test: New set of tests, taken from Guile's test
	script, taken from SCM.

	* tests/ports.test: Group the string port tests under a new
	test name prefix.

	* tests/ports.test ("line counter"): Check the final column, too.

	* lib.scm: Import (test-suite paths).
	(data-file): New exported function.

1999-06-12  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test ("line counter"): Add test for correct column
	at EOF.

1999-06-09  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test ("line counter"): Verify that we do eventually
	get EOF on the port --- don't just read forever.

	* lib.scm (full-reporter): The test name is the cadr of the
	result, not the cdr.  I'm not macho enough to handle run-time
	typechecking.

	* lib.scm (print-counts): XFAILS are "expected failures", not
	"unexpected failures."

	* lib.scm, guile-test, paths.scm: Log begins.
