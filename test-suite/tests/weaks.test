;;; {Description} 

;;; This is a semi test suite for weaks; I say semi, because weaks
;;; are pretty non-deterministic given the amount of information we
;;; can infer from scheme.
;;;
;;; In particular, we can't always reliably test the more important
;;; aspects of weaks (i.e., that an object is removed when it's dead)
;;; because we have no way of knowing for certain that the object is
;;; really dead. It tests it anyway, but the failures of any `death'
;;; tests really shouldn't be surprising.
;;;
;;; Interpret failures in the dying functions here as a hint that you
;;; should look at any changes you've made involving weaks
;;; (everything else should always pass), but there are a host of
;;; other reasons why they might not work as tested here, so if you
;;; haven't done anything to weaks, don't sweat it :)
