This directory contains some tests for Guile, and some generic test
support code.

Right now, we only have tests for I/O ports.

To run the test suite, you'll need to:
- edit the path to the guile interpreter in `guile-test', and 
- edit the paths in `paths.scm', so `guile-test' can find the test
  scripts.

Once that's done, you can just run the `guile-test' script.  That
script has usage instructions in the comments at the top.

You can reference the file `lib.scm' from your own code as the module
(test-suite lib); it also has comments at the top and before each
function explaining what's going on.

Please write more Guile tests, and send them to bug-guile@gnu.org.
We'll merge them into the distribution.  All test suites must be
licensed for our use under the GPL, but I don't think I'm going to
collect assignment papers for them.
