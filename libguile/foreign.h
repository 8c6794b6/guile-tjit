/* Foreign functions */

/* The goal is to make it so that calling a foreign function doesn't cause any
   heap allocation. That means we need native Scheme formats for all kinds of
   arguments.

   For "value" types like s64 or f32, we just use native Scheme value types.
   (Note that in both these cases, allocation is possible / likely, as the
   value might need to be boxed, but perhaps we won't worry about that. Hmm.)

   For everything else, we use foreign pointers. This includes arrays, pointer
   arguments and return vals, struct args and return vals, and out and in/out
   arguments.
