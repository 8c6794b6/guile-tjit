   `__gnu_inline__' is not used.

   C99 mode and doesn't define `__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__'.  Fall back to "static

     deferencing a random immediate value.  srfi-1.test exposes the problem
     through a short list, the immediate being SCM_EOL in that case.
     Something in syntax.test exposed the ceval() problem.

     Just "volatile SCM workaround_for_gcc_295 = lst" is enough to avoid the
