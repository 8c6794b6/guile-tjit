Random notes about dynamic linking for Guile. I will update this file
as I go along. Comments are very welcome.

The dynamic linking support is mostly untested. I can't test it
because I don't have all the different platforms, of course. Please
try it out.

To enable support for dynamic linking in libguile, give the

    --enable-dynamic-linking

option to configure. It is disabled by default because it will
probably cause lots of problems in its present state. Currently there
is support for -ldld, -ldl, HP-UX (and VMS, but not really).

Files affected:

 dynl*           new
 configure.in    add --enable-dynamic-linking option and checking for
                 system dependencies
 Makefile.am     include dynl* in build and dist.
 init.c          initialize dynamic linking support

Here is my plan with indications of progress.

- port "dynl.c" and maybe some parts of "Link.scm" from SCM to
  Guile. This should not be difficult, maybe I can even squeeze the
  VMS code into the "dynl:link", "dyn:call" interface.

* Mostly done, except VMS, and almost completely untested. The -dl
  support should work, but the rest has not even been compiled.

  The code is in the "dynl*" files. "dynl.c" is the system independent
  portion and includes the appropriate system dependent file, either
  "dynl-dld.c", "dynl-dl.c" or "dynl-shl.c".

  I have renamed the SCM names of the functions, because they didnn't
  fit very well into Guile, the semantics are the same:

    SCM name       Guile name

    dynl:link      dynamic-link
    dynl:call      dynamic-call
    dynl:main-call dynamic-args-call
    dynl:unlink    dynamic-unlink

  I plan to generalise dynamic-call and dynamic-args-call to work with
  arbitrary arguments, so these names are likely to change.

  PROBLEMS:

  When including dynlink support in libguile you need to link your
  applications with additional libraries (-ldl or -ldld). How do you
  communicate this to "guile" and "gh_test" for example? Some PLUGIN
  magic?

  You may need to link your application in a special way to make
  dynamic linking work. For example, on Linux and a statically linked
  libguile.a, you need -rdynamic to make the libguile symbols
  available for dynamic linking. The solution is probably to build
  libguile as a shared library on the systems that support it. Does
  libtool help here? Where can I find it?


- see how to couple dynamic linking with the module system. Dynamic
  objects should have a way to specify the module they want to add
  their bindings to. Extend this to statically linked parts of
  guile. (i.e. posix could be put into a module and initialized on
  demand)

* Maybe it will suffice to have scm_make_gsubr, etc to honor the
  current scm_top_level_lookup_closure and do all the module switching
  from Scheme.


- use gtcltk as a test case for the above, so that TCL/Tk capabilities
  can be added to guile at runtime.

- see how G-Wrap and libffi can work together and extend dyn:call to
  functions taking arbitrary arguments. Something along the lines

    (define XOpenDisplay (make-foreign-function X11-lib 'XOpenDisplay
						.. whatever args ..))


I have no ideas how to support the development of packages for Guile
that can be dynamically linked into a running application.  Maybe
automake can be used to automate most of the issues.

One nice thing is, however, that developers and users of Guile
packages have already installed Guile. So we might able to use Scheme
to describe and handle the build process. I would like that much more
than the arcane shell based implementations of autoconf, automake,
etc.
