/* Fluids.

   Fluids are objects of a certain type that can hold one SCM value per
   dynamic state. That is, modifications to this value are only visible
   to code that executes with the same dynamic state as the modifying
   code. When a new dynamic state is constructed, it inherits the
   values from its parent. Because each thread executes with its own
   dynamic state, you can use fluids for thread local storage.

   Each fluid is identified by a small integer. This integer is used to
   index a vector that holds the values of all fluids. A dynamic state
   consists of this vector, wrapped in an object so that the vector can
   grow.
