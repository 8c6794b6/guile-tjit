/* {Poll}
 */

/* Poll a set of file descriptors, waiting until one or more of them is
   ready to perform input or output.

   This is a low-level interface.  See the `(ice-9 poll)' module for a more
   usable wrapper.

   `pollfds' is expected to be a bytevector, laid out in contiguous blocks of 64
   bits.  Each block has the format of one `struct pollfd': a 32-bit int file
   descriptor, a 16-bit int events mask, and a 16-bit int revents mask.

   The number of pollfd structures in `pollfds' is specified in
   `nfds'. `pollfds' must be at least long enough to support that number of
   structures. It may be longer, in which case the trailing entries are left
   untouched.

   The pollfds bytevector is modified directly, setting the returned events in
   the final two bytes (the revents member).

   Since Scheme ports can buffer input or output in userspace, a Scheme
   poll interface needs to take that into account as well.  The `ports'
   argument, a vector big enough for `nfds' elements, is given for this
   purpose.  If a pollfd entry has a corresponding open port, that port
   is scanned for available input or output before dropping into the
   poll.  If any port has buffered I/O available, the poll syscall is
   still issued, but with a timeout of 0 milliseconds, and a full port
   scan occurs after the poll returns.

   If timeout is given and is non-negative, the poll will return after that
   number of milliseconds if no fd became active.
