/* scm_internal_catch is the guts of catch.  It handles all the
   mechanics of setting up a catch target, invoking the catch body,
   and perhaps invoking the handler if the body does a throw.

   The function is designed to be usable from C code, but is general
   enough to implement all the semantics Guile Scheme expects from
   throw.

   TAG is the catch tag.  Typically, this is a symbol, but this
   function doesn't actually care about that.

   BODY is a pointer to a C function which runs the body of the catch;
   this is the code you can throw from.  We call it like this:
      BODY (BODY_DATA)
   where:
      BODY_DATA is just the BODY_DATA argument we received; we pass it
	 through to BODY as its first argument.  The caller can make
	 BODY_DATA point to anything useful that BODY might need.

   HANDLER is a pointer to a C function to deal with a throw to TAG,
   should one occur.  We call it like this:
      HANDLER (HANDLER_DATA, THROWN_TAG, THROW_ARGS)
   where
      HANDLER_DATA is the HANDLER_DATA argument we recevied; it's the
         same idea as BODY_DATA above.
      THROWN_TAG is the tag that the user threw to; usually this is
         TAG, but it could be something else if TAG was #t (i.e., a
         catch-all), or the user threw to a jmpbuf.
      THROW_ARGS is the list of arguments the user passed to the THROW
         function, after the tag.

   BODY_DATA is just a pointer we pass through to BODY.  HANDLER_DATA
   is just a pointer we pass through to HANDLER.  We don't actually
   use either of those pointers otherwise ourselves.  The idea is
   that, if our caller wants to communicate something to BODY or
   HANDLER, it can pass a pointer to it as MUMBLE_DATA, which BODY and
   HANDLER can then use.  Think of it as a way to make BODY and
   HANDLER closures, not just functions; MUMBLE_DATA points to the
   enclosed variables.

   Of course, it's up to the caller to make sure that any data a
   MUMBLE_DATA needs is protected from GC.  A common way to do this is
   to make MUMBLE_DATA a pointer to data stored in an automatic
   structure variable; since the collector must scan the stack for
   references anyway, this assures that any references in MUMBLE_DATA
   will be found.  */
