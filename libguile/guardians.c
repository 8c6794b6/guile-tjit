/* This is an implementation of guardians as described in
 * R. Kent Dybvig, Carl Bruggeman, and David Eby (1993) "Guardians in
 * a Generation-Based Garbage Collector" ACM SIGPLAN Conference on
 * Programming Language Design and Implementation, June 1993
 * ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/doc/pubs/guardians.ps.gz
 *
 * Original design:          Mikael Djurfeldt
 * Original implementation:  Michael Livshin
 * Hacked on since by:       everybody
 *
 * By this point, the semantics are actually quite different from
 * those described in the abovementioned paper.  The semantic changes
 * are there to improve safety and intuitiveness.  The interface is
 * still (mostly) the one described by the paper, however.
 *
 * Boiled down again:        Marius Vollmer
 *
 * Now they should again behave like those described in the paper.
 * Scheme guardians should be simple and friendly, not like the greedy
 * monsters we had...
 *
 * Rewritten for the Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC by Ludovic Courtès.
