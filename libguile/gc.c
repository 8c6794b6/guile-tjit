/* {heap tuning parameters}
 *
 * These are parameters for controlling memory allocation.  The heap
 * is the area out of which scm_cons, and object headers are allocated.
 *
 * Each heap cell is 8 bytes on a 32 bit machine and 16 bytes on a
 * 64 bit machine.  The units of the _SIZE parameters are bytes.
 * Cons pairs and object headers occupy one heap cell.
 *
 * SCM_INIT_HEAP_SIZE is the initial size of heap.  If this much heap is
 * allocated initially the heap will grow by half its current size
 * each subsequent time more heap is needed.
 *
 * If SCM_INIT_HEAP_SIZE heap cannot be allocated initially, SCM_HEAP_SEG_SIZE
 * will be used, and the heap will grow by SCM_HEAP_SEG_SIZE when more
 * heap is needed.  SCM_HEAP_SEG_SIZE must fit into type size_t.  This code
 * is in scm_init_storage() and alloc_some_heap() in sys.c
 *
 * If SCM_INIT_HEAP_SIZE can be allocated initially, the heap will grow by
 * SCM_EXPHEAP(scm_heap_size) when more heap is needed.
 *
 * SCM_MIN_HEAP_SEG_SIZE is minimum size of heap to accept when more heap
 * is needed.
 *
 * INIT_MALLOC_LIMIT is the initial amount of malloc usage which will
 * trigger a GC.
 *
 * SCM_MTRIGGER_HYSTERESIS is the amount of malloc storage that must be
 * reclaimed by a GC triggered by must_malloc. If less than this is
 * reclaimed, the trigger threshold is raised. [I don't know what a
 * good value is. I arbitrarily chose 1/10 of the INIT_MALLOC_LIMIT to
 * work around a oscillation that caused almost constant GC.]

   * things.
   * 
   * To overcome this problem, if cell access debugging with additional
   * garbage collections is enabled, the after-gc-hook is never run by the
   * garbage collecter.  When running guile with cell access debugging and the
   * execution of the after-gc-hook is desired, then it is necessary to run
   * the hook explicitly from the user code.  This has the effect, that from
   * the scheme level point of view it seems that garbage collection is
   * performed with a much lower frequency than it actually is.  Obviously,
   * this will not work for code that depends on a fixed one to one
   * relationship between the execution counts of the C level garbage
   * collection hooks and the execution count of the scheme level
   * after-gc-hook.
