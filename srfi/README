This directory includes most of Guile's SRFI support.       -*- text -*-

For more details about what SRFI means, and what the various numbers
stand for, please refer to the SRFI homepage at

  http://srfi.schemers.org

The following SRFIs are supported (as of 2001-05-22 -- 'martin):

SRFI-0: cond-expand

  Supported by default, no module needs to get used.

SRFI-2: and-let*

  (use-modules (srfi srfi-2)) to make and-let* available.

SRFI-6: open-input-string, open-output-string and get-output-string

  (use-modules (srfi srfi-6)) to make these available. (Currently,
  these procedures are available without using the module, but the
  procedures might be factored out of the core library in the
  future.)

SRFI-8: receive

  (use-modules (srfi srfi-8)) to make receive available.

SRFI-9: define-record-type

  A mechanism for defining record types.  (use-modules (srfi srfi-9))
  makes this syntactic form available.

SRFI-10: #,()

  The hash-comma reader extension.  (use-modules (srfi srfi-10))
  activates the extension.

SRFI-11: let-values and let-values*

  Syntactic extensions for handling multiple values.  (use-modules
  (srfi srfi-11)) makes these syntactic forms available.

SRFI-13: string library

  A lot of (more or less) useful string processing procedures.
  (use-modules (srfi srfi-13)) loads the procedures.

SRFI-14: character-set library

  Character-set library.  (use-modules (srfi srfi-14)) loads the
  procedures and standard variables.

SRFI-16: case-lambda

  Syntactic form which permits writing functions acting different
  according to the number of arguments passed.  (use-modules (srfi
  srfi-16)) makes this syntactic form available.

SRFI-17: Generalized set!

  Guile supports generalized set! by default, but this module makes it
  fully compliant to the SRFI.  (use-modules (srfi srfi-17)) loads the
  procedures.

SRFI-19: Time Data Types and Procedures

  A lot of data types and procedures for dealing with times and
  dates.  (use-modules (srfi srfi-19)) loads the procedures.

SRFI-23: Error reporting mechanism (draft)

  This SRFI is still in draft status, but Guile fully supports it
  already.  No need to load any module.
