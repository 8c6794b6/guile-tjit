BUGS

This file contains bugs we haven't fixed yet, and some we have.
The format is very simple (one bug per page):

#   line				   regexp

1   bug NUMBER -- ONE-LINE-DESCRIPTION	   ^bug ([0-9]+) -- (.+)$
2   reported-by: SOMEONE / DATE		   ^reported-by: ([^/]) */ *(.+)$
3   fixed: DATE (for guile VERSION)	   ^fixed: (.+) .for guile (.+).$
4+  OTHER-NOTES

DATE is formatted YYY-MM-DD, or "not-yet".  Line numbering is zero-origin;
line 0 is empty (newline always follows newpage (recognizable w/ "\f\n")).
The suggested regexps can be used in a line-oriented parser.


bug 0 -- no BUGS file
reported-by: ttn / 2001-09-25
fixed: 2001-09-30 (1.5.x, 1.7.x)

bugs are good.


bug 1 -- (debug-disable 'debug) has no effect if first form in ~/.guile
reported-by: Sven.Hartrumpf@fernuni-hagen.de / 2001-08-31
fixed: not-yet

ttn sez:
buggy behavior confirmed on both 1.5.x and 1.7.x.

on the other hand, when second or later, the expected effect (disabling use of
debugging evaluator) seems to be reflected when viewing the debug options.  it
could be that the bug is in display and not the actual setting.


bug 2 -- documentation mirroring not complete
reported-by: lord@regexps.com / 2001-08
fixed: not-yet

ttn sez:
uncollated mirroring is already available:
http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/guile/
http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/guile-devel/


bug 3 -- design decisions not recorded
reported-by: lord@regexps.com / 2001-08
fixed: not-yet

changes are made w/ little documentation on their motivation, design and
consequences.  past initiatives and current maintainer discipline to support
them need shoring up.

ttn sez:
someone also mentioned that process and product are orthogonal; nastiness can
result in/from either, and for different reasons.  i tend to believe this up
until a certain point, when the process becomes self-aware and includes its own
improvement in its considerations.  then, hopefully it becomes light.

to change people is difficult, but that's why we have guile...
