BUGS

This file contains bugs we haven't fixed yet, and some we have.
The format is very simple (one bug per page):

bug NUMBER -- ONE-LINE-DESCRIPTION
reported-by: SOMEONE / DATE
fixed: DATE (for guile VERSION)
OTHER-NOTES


bug 0 -- no BUGS file
reported-by: ttn / 2001-09-25
fixed: 2001-09-30 (1.5.x, 1.7.x)

all bugs are good bugs!


bug 1 -- (debug-disable 'debug) has no effect if first form in ~/.guile
reported-by: Sven.Hartrumpf@fernuni-hagen.de / 2001-08-31
fixed:

buggy behavior confirmed on both 1.5.x and 1.7.x (ttn).

on the other hand, when second or later, the expected effect (disabling use of
debugging evaluator) seems to be reflected when viewing the debug options.  it
could be that the bug is in display and not the actual setting.
