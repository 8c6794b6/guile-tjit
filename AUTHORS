Aubrey Jaffer:
is the author of SCM, the Scheme interpreter upon which Guile is
based.  Guile started from SCM version 4e1 in November -94 and is
still largely composed of the original SCM code.

George Carrette:
wrote files present in Siod version 2.3, released in December of 1989.
Siod was the starting point for SCM.  The major innovations taken from
Siod are the evaluator's use of the C-stack and being able to garbage
collect off the C-stack
