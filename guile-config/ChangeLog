	* guile-config.in (build-compile, help-compile, usage-compile):
	New functions to implement new subcommand.

	* guile-config.in: Redo the help system, so that each subcommand
	defines its own usage text, as well as its help text.

	* guile-config.in (build-link): Include a -L option in the output
	from `guile-config link', indicating where libguile was installed.
	(Thanks to Greg Troxel.)

1998-10-03  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* guile-config.in: Don't import ice-9 regex; that's not available
	on all systems.  Maybe someday we'll have our own...
	(set-program-name!): Use basename.
	(build-link): Use basename and stock string functions, instead of
	string-match.
	(Bug report from Greg Troxel --- thanks!)

	* Directory renamed to guile-config from build.
	* guile-config.in: Renamed from build-guile.in, for consistency
 	with the analogous script for GTK, called gtk-config.
	* Makefile.am, .cvsignore: References to `build-guile' replaced
	with `guile-config'.

	* build-guile.in: Rearranged to use a table of subcommands, and
 	include per-subcommand help.
