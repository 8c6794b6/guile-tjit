## Commentary:

## This fragment defines two variables: workbook and mscripts.
## These are only defined in MAINTAINER_MODE.
## It can be included in any Makefile.am by adding the line:
##   include $(top_srcdir)/am/maintainer-dirs
## See $(workbook)/build/maintainer-dirs.text for more info.

## Code:

if MAINTAINER_MODE
workbook	= $(top_srcdir_absolute)/../workbook
mscripts	= $(top_srcdir_absolute)/../scripts
endif

## am/maintainer-dirs ends here
