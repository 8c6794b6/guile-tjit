This is a checklist for making Guile releases.
It's specific to the FSF's development environment; please don't put
it in the distribution.

Maybe we should name Guile releases after entertaining poisons:
absinthe, etc.  However, the first release containing the module
system should be called Godot: "This is the one you've been waiting
for."

=== Eventually:

* Deprecate `read-only-string?'.

After signal handling and threading have been fixed:
- remove the code corresponding to GUILE_OLD_ASYNC_CLICK and the corresponding
  GUILE_OLD_ASYNC_CLICK macro.

=== In release 1.6.0:

- Make sure that the deprecation mechanism explained in INSTALL and
  README is completed and works.

=== In release 1.8.0:

- remove deprecated subr and gsubr functions
    in procs.h, procs.c: scm_make_subr, scm_make_subr_opt,
      scm_make_subr_with_generic,
    in gsubr.h, gsubr.c: scm_make_gsubr, scm_make_gsubr_with_generic.
    
- remove deprecated C interface to modules
    in modules.h, modules.c:
      root_module_lookup_closure, scm_sym_app, scm_sym_modules,
      module_prefix, make_modules_in_var, beautify_user_module_x_var,
      scm_the_root_module, scm_make_module, scm_ensure_user_module,
      scm_load_scheme_module

- remove vcell and obarray support.
  Remove all code bracketed by `#if SCM_ENABLE_VCELLS'.
  Remove SCM_ENABLE_VCELLS itself.
  Also remove `variable-set-name-hint' completely.

- remove compatability module (ice-9 and-let*).  It
  has been replaced by (ice-9 and-let-star) and/or (srfi srfi-2).

- remove support for autoloading compiled-code modules:
    try-module-linked
    try-module-dynamic-link
    init-dynamic-module
    scm_register_module_xxx
    etc.
- remove deprecated variables:
    scm_top_level_lookup_closure_var
    scm_scm_system_transformer
    Remove all code that still sets them:
     `use-syntax', scm_set_current_module, ...

- remove deprecated functions:
    eval.c: scm_eval2, scm_eval_3
    load.c: scm_read_and_eval_x
    smob.c: scm_make_smob_type_mfpe, scm_set_smob_mfpe
    gc.c: scm_remember
    string.c: scm_makstr
- remove deprecated procedures:
    boot-9.scm: eval-in-module, id, -1+, return-it, string-character-length,
      flags
- remove deprecated macros: SCM_OUTOFRANGE, SCM_NALLOC, SCM_HUP_SIGNAL, 
  SCM_INT_SIGNAL, SCM_FPE_SIGNAL, SCM_BUS_SIGNAL, SCM_SEGV_SIGNAL, 
  SCM_ALRM_SIGNAL, SCM_GC_SIGNAL, SCM_TICK_SIGNAL, SCM_SIG_ORD, 
  SCM_ORD_SIG, SCM_NUM_SIGS, SCM_SLOPPY_STRINGP, SCM_VALIDATE_STRINGORSUBSTR,
  SCM_FREEP, SCM_NFREEP, SCM_CHARS, SCM_UCHARS, SCM_VALIDATE_ROSTRING,
  SCM_VALIDATE_ROSTRING_COPY, SCM_VALIDATE_NULLORROSTRING_COPY, SCM_ROLENGTH,
  SCM_LENGTH, SCM_HUGE_LENGTH, SCM_SUBSTRP, SCM_SUBSTR_STR, SCM_SUBSTR_OFFSET,
  SCM_COERCE_SUBSTR, SCM_ROSTRINGP, SCM_RWSTRINGP, SCM_VALIDATE_RWSTRING,
  SCM_ROCHARS, SCM_ROUCHARS, SCM_SETLENGTH, SCM_SETCHARS, SCM_LENGTH_MAX,
  SCM_GC8MARKP, SCM_SETGC8MARK, SCM_CLRGC8MARK, SCM_GCTYP16, SCM_GCCDR,
  SCM_SUBR_DOC, SCM_OPDIRP, SCM_VALIDATE_OPDIR, SCM_WTA, RETURN_SCM_WTA,
  SCM_WNA, SCM_FUNC_NAME, SCM_VALIDATE_NUMBER_COPY,
  SCM_VALIDATE_NUMBER_DEF_COPY, SCM_SLOPPY_CONSP, SCM_SLOPPY_NCONSP,
  SCM_SETAND_CDR, SCM_SETOR_CDR, SCM_SETAND_CAR, SCM_SETOR_CAR,
  SCM_ARRAY_CONTIGUOUS
- remove scm_vector_set_length_x
- remove function scm_call_catching_errors
  (replaced by catch functions from throw.[ch])
- remove support for "#&" reader syntax in (ice-9 optargs).
- remove scm_make_shared_substring
- remove scm_read_only_string_p
- remove scm_strhash
- remove scm_tc7_ssymbol
- remove scm_tc7_msymbol
- remove scm_tcs_symbols
- remove scm_sloppy_memq, scm_sloppy_memv, scm_sloppy_member
- consider removing the automatic loading of (ice-9 rdelim) when guile
  starts up.  This would be a brave move, since a lot of code will
  assume that read-line is available by default.  However it would make
  it easier to use alternative implementations of this module, e.g., a
  strictly scsh-compatible version which uses multiple values.  For
  interactive use it would be easy to load the module in ~/.guile.
- remove scm_close_all_ports_except
- remove scm_strprint_obj
- remove SCM_CONST_LONG
- remove scm_wta
- remove deprecated typedefs: long_long, ulong_long, scm_sizet
- remove deprecated macros: scm_contregs, scm_port_rw_active,
  scm_port, scm_ptob_descriptor, scm_debug_info, scm_debug_frame,
  scm_fport, SCM_FIXNUM_BIT, scm_option, scm_subr_entry, scm_rstate,
  scm_rng, scm_i_rstate, scm_srcprops, scm_srcprops_chunk,
  scm_info_frame, scm_stack, scm_array, scm_array_dim.
- remove deprecated functions: scm_mkbig, scm_big2num, scm_adjbig,
  scm_normbig, scm_copybig, scm_2ulong2big, scm_dbl2big, scm_big2dbl.
- remove deprecated functions: scm_protect_object,
  scm_unprotect_object, scm_create_hook.

Modules sort.c and random.c should be factored out into separate
modules (but still be distributed with guile-core) when we get a new
module system.

Release Checklists ===================================================

There are basically two phases to doing a release:

* "SPIFFING": Updating NEWS, README, INSTALL.  Running tests.  Getting
  people to try builds on various machines.  Getting everything
  straightened up.

* "PUNTING": Updating the version numbers.  Tagging the sources.  Asking
  the FSF to put the disty on ftp.gnu.org.  Posting announcements.

The "Spiffing" phase you might go through several times as you
discover problems.  The "Punting" phase you do only once.


Spiffing checklist:

* Do a `cvs update -A', to get rid of any sticky tags in your working
  directory.
* Check for files that have changed a lot, but do not have up-to-date
  copyright notices.  This can be as simple as doing:
 	grep 'Copyright' * | grep -v 1999
  and looking for files you know you've worked on a lot.
* Make sure NEWS, INSTALL, AUTHORS and THANKS and the docs are up to date:
  + Scan the ChangeLogs for user-visible changes, marked with an asterisk
    at the left margin.
  + Update NEWS and the Texinfo documentation as appropriate.
  + Remove the user-visible markers from the log entries once they're
    documented.
  + Check for any [[incomplete]] sections of NEWS.
  + Fact-check INSTALL.
  + Make sure AUTHORS and THANKS are up-to-date.
* Make sure the downloading addresses and filenames in README are
  current.  (But don't bump the version number yet.  We do that below.)
* Check that the versions of aclocal, automake, autoconf, and autoheader
  in your PATH match those given in HACKING.  Note that the `make
  dist' process always invokes these tools, even when all the
  generated files are up to date.
* Rebuild all generated files in the source tree:
  + Install the .m4 files where aclocal will find them.
  + Run aclocal.
  + Run autoconf.
  + Run autoheader.
  + Run automake.
* Verify that Guile builds and runs in your working directory.
* Run the test suite, in guile-core/test-suite.
* Commit all changes to the CVS repository.
* Build a test distribution.
  + BEFORE doing 'make dist', configure the source tree for build
    in the same tree with configuration options
    --enable-maintainer-mode --enable-debug-malloc --with-threads.
  + Make sure that readline was enabled correctly.
  + Build the tree.
    (If the above steps are not done, the dependencies won't be properly
    included in the generated Makefile.in files.)
  + Then do 'make dist'.
  + Check that the dependencies in guile-readline/Makefile look OK.
    (We currently use a kludge which edits the dependencies generated
    by automake so that Guile can be built in a directory separate
    from the source tree also with non-GNU make programs.)
* Give the test disty to various people to try.  Here's what you should do:
  + Unset GUILE_LOAD_PATH.
  + Remove automake and autoconf from your path, or turn off their
    execute bits, or something.  (Users must be able to build the
    disty without installing those tools.)
  + Configure, make, and install.
  + Make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH doesn't include anything unnecessary.
  + Run the test suite on the installed version.
  + You might try the example code in the doc directory.

Once you've got a disty that seems pretty solid:

* Choose new interface numbers for shared libraries.
* Update the version numbers in GUILE-VERSION and README.  (There are
  many places in README that need updating!)  The Guile version
  number should have one of the following forms:
    N.M                      - a major release
    N.M.L, where L is even   - a minor release
    N.M.L, where L is odd    - sources from CVS or nightly snapshot
* Reformat the names in THANKS.
* Do a `cvs update -A' of the whole tree, to look for any stray
  uncommitted or accidental changes.
* Commit your changes.
* Make one last test distribution.

Punting checklist:

* Add "Guile N.M released." entry to the top-level ChangeLog, and commit it.
* Tag the entire source tree with a tag of the form "release_N_M" 
  or "release_N_M_L".
* Do a 'make dist'.
* Put the distribution up for FTP somewhere, and send mail to
  ftp-upload@gnu.org, asking them to put it on prep.
* Send an announcement message to gnu-announce@gnu.org.  Put a brief
  summary of the changes in this release first, then "Obtaining
  Guile", "Thanks", "About This Distribution," and "Nightly
  Snapshots."  If I remember correctly, the moderator will delay it
  until the distribution appears on ftp.gnu.org.  The announcement
  text should be mostly taken from Guile's README file.
* Notify freshmeat.net, although they're probably watching anyway.
  (They got the 1.3 release just fine.)  I have no idea if
  www.bowerbird.com.au will be something anyone refers to, but Guile
  does have an entry there.
* Tweak the version numbers in GUILE-VERSION, and README to indicate
  that the sources are a snapshot again.  Snapshots should have
  version numbers of the form "N.M.L", where L is odd.
* Start a new section of the NEWS file.
* Start a new THANKS file.
