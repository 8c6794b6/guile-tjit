;; This is a grab bag of stuff for doing "gdb guile" in Emacs.
;; The var `gdb-guile-suggested-gdbinit' has a string that is
;; snarfed from ../HACKING.  (todo: Write `gdb-guile-init' to
;; send it to gdb...)

;;; Code:

(require 'cl)

(defun gdb-guile-display-scm ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (let ((sym (thing-at-point 'symbol))
          (proc (get-buffer-process
                 (find-if (lambda (buf)
                            (string-match "^.gud-." (buffer-name buf)))
                          (buffer-list)))))
      (mapc (lambda (template)
              (process-send-string proc (format template sym)))
            (list
             "set gdb_print(%s)\n"
             "printf \"%s: %%s\\n\", gdb_output\n")))))
