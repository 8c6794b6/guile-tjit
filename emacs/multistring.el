;; Commands for editing multiline ANSI C compatible string literals.

;;; Code:

(defun ms-ansify-string (arg)
    "Convert a string literal spanning multiple lines into multiple literals.
With no argument, convert the single string at point to multiple strings.
With an argument, convert multiple strings to a single one.

ANSI C doesn't allow a string literal to span multiple lines.  This
function makes editing of multiline strings easier.

The programmer can edit a string spanning multiple lines and then use
this function to convert it into multiple literals representing the
original string through the ANSI C string concatenation feature:

  \"A string consisting of
  multiple
  lines.\"

is converted into

  \"A string consisting of\n\"
  \"multiple\n\"
  \"lines\""

	(if (not arg)
	    (ms-break-string))
	(setq beg (point-min))
	(setq end (point-max)))
      (if (not arg)
	  (c-indent-region beg end)))))

(defun ms-pack-region (from to &optional unpack-flag)
  "Pack paragraphs into single lines and remove one newline after paragraphs.
With no argument, do the conversion.
With an argument, do the reverse.

When doing the reverse conversion, \\[fill-region] is used to break up
the text into multiple lines."

(defun ms-pack-ansify-string (arg)
  "Pack text in a string literal and convert into multiple literals.
With no argument, do the conversion.
With an argument, do the reverse.

This command has the combined effect of \\[ms-pack-region] and
\\[ms-ansify-string].  It is typically used if you want to store
entire paragraphs without newlines in an ANSI C literal, but want to
split it into multiple literals in order for the program text to look
sensible.  Using the reverse command, you can \"unpack\" the text,
edit it and repack the text using the forward conversion."
