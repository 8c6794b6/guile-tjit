Known GDS problems

* gds-load-file (C-c C-l) doesn't work

This is because it isn't yet implemented in gds-client.scm.

* Incomplete expressions aren't reported nicely

In code sent for evaluation, that is.  Currently this is reported as a
GDS Internal Error.  It should be reported like error-in-evaluation
and, in cases where the code evaluated contained multiple expressions,
should correctly show the results of evaluating the expressions that
were read before the read error was noticed..

* In the debugger, `e' (gds-evaluate) isn't easy to use

Because it doesn't pop up the result!  (You can see the result with `v
m', but these extra keys shouldn't be needed.)
