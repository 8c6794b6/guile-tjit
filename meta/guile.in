# Commentary:

# Usage: guile [ARGS]
#
# This script arranges for the environment to support, and eventaully execs,
# the uninstalled binary guile executable located somewhere under libguile/,
# passing ARGS to it.  In the process, env var GUILE is clobbered, and the
# following env vars are modified (but not clobbered):
#   GUILE_LOAD_PATH
#   LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH
#
# This script can be used as a drop-in replacement for $bindir/guile;
# if there is a discrepency in behavior, that's a bug.

# Code:

# env (set by configure)
top_builddir="@top_builddir_absolute@"

# set GUILE (clobber)
GUILE=${top_builddir}/libguile/guile@EXEEXT@
export GUILE
XDG_CACHE_HOME=${top_builddir}/cache
export XDG_CACHE_HOME

# do it
if test "@cross_compiling@" = "no"; then
    exec ${top_builddir}/meta/uninstalled-env $GUILE "$@"
else
    exec @GUILE_FOR_BUILD@ "$@"
fi

# never reached
exit 1

# guile ends here
