# Commentary:

# Usage: gdb-uninstalled-guile [ARGS]
#
# This script runs Guile from the build tree under GDB. See
# ./guile for more information.
#
# In addition to running ./gdb-uninstalled-guile, sometimes it's useful to
# run e.g. ./check-guile -i meta/gdb-uninstalled-guile foo.test.

# Code:

set -e
# env (set by configure)
top_builddir="@top_builddir_absolute@"
exec ${top_builddir}/uninstalled-env libtool --mode=execute \
    gdb --args ${top_builddir}/libguile/guile "$@"
